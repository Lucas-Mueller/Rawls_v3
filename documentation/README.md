The detailed diagrams show implementation-level components and are useful for developers and technical implementers. These include all 7 original diagrams with comprehensive component details.

## Architectural Principles

The MAAI Frohlich Experiment system is built on several key architectural principles:

### 1. **Modular Design**
- Clear separation of concerns between configuration, orchestration, agents, and data layers
- Each component has well-defined responsibilities and interfaces
- Enables independent testing and development of system components

### 2. **Multi-Agent Architecture**
- Distinct participant agents and utility agents with specialized roles
- Support for heterogeneous agent configurations within single experiments
- Sophisticated inter-agent communication and coordination mechanisms

### 3. **Experimental Fidelity**
- Precise replication of original Frohlich & Oppenheimer experimental protocols
- Configurable modes for both historical replication and novel research conditions
- Comprehensive validation systems to ensure experimental integrity

### 4. **Robustness and Error Handling**
- Multi-layered error detection and recovery mechanisms
- Graceful degradation under failure conditions
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring for debugging and analysis

### 5. **Scalability and Performance**
- Parallel processing capabilities for Phase 1 individual interactions
- Efficient resource management and API optimization
- Support for large-scale experimental programs and batch execution

### 6. **Data Integrity and Reproducibility**
- Comprehensive data collection and validation systems
- Complete experimental trace capabilities for reproducibility
- Structured data formats for downstream statistical analysis

## System Components Detail

### Configuration Layer
- **YAML-based configuration**: Flexible experimental parameter specification
- **Pydantic models**: Type-safe configuration validation and data structures
- **Multi-language support**: Localized configurations for cross-cultural research

### Agent Management
- **Participant agents**: Primary experimental subjects with configurable personalities and capabilities
- **Utility agents**: Specialized parsing, validation, and consensus detection functions
- **Memory management**: Persistent, agent-managed memory systems with character limits
- **Bank account systems**: Economic incentive tracking with earnings accumulation

### Experimental Orchestration
- **Phase managers**: Specialized coordinators for Phase 1 and Phase 2 experimental flows
- **Distribution generation**: Dynamic and original values modes for income distribution scenarios
- **Consensus detection**: Multi-tiered consensus determination with exact and semantic matching

### Data and Logging
- **Agent-centric logging**: Comprehensive traces of all agent interactions and decisions
- **Economic tracking**: Detailed earnings, payoffs, and counterfactual analysis
- **Temporal analysis**: Time-series data for preference evolution and group dynamics studies
- **Export capabilities**: JSON, CSV, and statistical software integration

## Usage Notes
