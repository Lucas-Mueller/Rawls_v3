    "experiment_explanation": "\nYou are participating in an experiment studying principles of justice and income distribution.\n\nThe experiment has two main phases:\n\nPHASE 1: You will individually learn about and apply four different principles of justice to income distributions. You will be asked to rank these principles by preference and apply them to specific scenarios. Your choices will affect your earnings.\n\nPHASE 2: You will join a group discussion to reach consensus on which principle of justice the group should adopt. The group's chosen principle will then be applied to determine everyone's final earnings.\n\nThroughout the experiment, maintain your assigned personality while engaging thoughtfully with the principles and other participants.\n",
