# Agent Response Validation Bug Report

**Date:** 2025-08-15

## 1. Summary

A critical bug has been identified in the Phase 2 group discussion logic. The system does not validate the content of statements received from agents. It accepts empty strings as valid conversational turns, causing the discussion to proceed even if an agent fails to provide a meaningful response. This can lead to a breakdown in the experiment's social dynamics and prevent the group from reaching a valid consensus.

## 2. Problem Description

The core issue is located in the `_run_group_discussion` method within `core/phase2_manager.py`. During each agent's turn, the system calls `_get_participant_statement_enhanced` to get the agent's public statement. The code currently takes the output from the model without checking if it is a valid, non-empty string.

As a result, if an agent model returns an empty response (`""`), the `Phase2Manager` treats it as a successful turn, adds the empty statement to the discussion history, and moves to the next participant.

## 3. Evidence

This bug was the primary cause of consensus failure in the experiment logged in `experiment_results_20250815_173506.json`.

- **Agent_3**, using the `gemini-2.5-pro` model, returned an empty `public_message` for rounds 1, 2, and 3 of the Phase 2 discussion.
- The other agents proceeded with the discussion, but were waiting for input from Agent_3, which never came until the final round.
- This silence, combined with a likely configuration error regarding a non-existent "Agent_6", made it impossible for the group to meet the requirements for a unanimous vote, leading to consensus failure.

## 4. Recommended Solution

The `_run_group_discussion` loop in `core/phase2_manager.py` should be modified to include response validation.

After the line `statement = result.final_output` in `_get_participant_statement_enhanced` (or immediately after the call to it in the main loop), a check should be added to ensure the `statement` is not null, empty, or only whitespace.

If an invalid statement is received, the system should implement a retry mechanism, re-prompting the agent for a valid response at least once before considering it a failed turn and logging a critical error.
