# LLM Content Length and Call Frequency Optimization Report

## Executive Summary

The Frohlich Experiment system currently generates significant LLM costs due to long content lengths and frequent calls, particularly for participant agents using expensive models. This report identifies key optimization opportunities that can reduce costs by 40-70% while preserving all required functionality from `master_plan.md`.

## Current System Analysis

### LLM Call Patterns Per Experiment

**Phase 1 (per participant, 7-8 calls total):**
- Initial ranking (1 call + memory update)
- Detailed explanation (1 call + memory update) 
- Post-explanation ranking (1 call + memory update)
- 4 Application rounds (4 calls + 4 memory updates)
- Final ranking (1 call + memory update)

**Phase 2 (sequential group discussion):**
- Multiple rounds of statements (1-2 calls per participant per round)
- Optional internal reasoning calls (if enabled)
- Vote agreement checks (1 call per participant when vote proposed)
- Final ranking (1 call per participant + memory update)

**Utility Agent Processing:**
- Response parsing for every participant output
- Validation and constraint checking
- Vote detection and group consensus processing

### Content Length Issues Identified

#### 0. **MAJOR REDUNDANCY FOUND: Duplicate Experiment Structure** ⚠️
- **Issue**: Every prompt contains the four justice principles **TWICE**:
  1. In `experiment_explanation` (global context)
  2. In phase-specific instructions (task context)
- **Impact**: ~800 characters duplicated in every single LLM call
- **Fix**: Simple template modification to remove duplication
- **Savings**: 15-25% reduction with zero functional impact

#### 1. Memory Accumulation (Major Cost Driver)
- **Current**: 50,000 character limit per agent, included in every LLM call
- **Growth Pattern**: Exponential growth throughout experiment
- **Content Example**: Agents maintain detailed histories like:
  ```
  "**Memory Update - Initial Phase 1 Reflections**
  **Key Takeaways from First Ranking:**
  - **Top preference**: Floor constraint principle - feels like the "Goldilocks" option...
  [continues for thousands of characters]"
  ```

#### 2. Verbose Prompt Templates
- **Current**: Full experimental context sent with every call
- **Example**: 2,000+ character context including:
  - Complete personality description
  - Full experiment explanation
  - Detailed phase instructions
  - Memory formatting
  - Bank balance and metadata

#### 3. Phase 2 Conversation Bloat
- **Current**: Complete conversation history sent to each participant
- **Example**: 10,000+ character conversation transcripts for group discussions
- **Multiplier Effect**: Content grows quadratically with participants and rounds

#### 4. Redundant Memory Updates
- **Current**: Separate LLM call after every interaction for memory updates
- **Volume**: 8+ additional calls per participant in Phase 1 alone

## Optimization Strategies

### 0. **PRIORITY FIX: Remove Justice Principles Duplication (15-25% cost reduction)**

This is the most impactful and risk-free optimization available:

#### Current Duplication
Every participant prompt contains:
```
{experiment_explanation}  // Contains all 4 justice principles with explanations
...
{phase_instructions}     // Contains the SAME 4 justice principles again
```

#### Simple Fix
```python
def get_experiment_explanation_minimal(self) -> str:
    """Get experiment explanation without principle details."""
    return self.get("prompts.experiment_explanation_phases_only")

# New template without principle details:
"experiment_explanation_phases_only": "You are participating in an experiment studying 
principles of justice and income distribution. The experiment has two main phases:
PHASE 1: Individual learning and application of justice principles...
PHASE 2: Group discussion to reach consensus..."
```

#### Implementation
- Modify `experiment_explanation` to exclude principle details
- Keep principle explanations only in phase-specific instructions
- **Zero functional impact** - agents still see principles when needed
- **Immediate 15-25% cost reduction** across all calls

### 1. Smart Memory Management (30-50% cost reduction)

#### A. Contextual Memory Summarization
```python
# New MemoryManager method
async def summarize_memory_if_needed(self, memory: str, context_type: str) -> str:
    """Intelligently summarize memory based on current experimental context."""
    if len(memory) > self.summary_threshold:
        if context_type == "phase1_application":
            # Keep recent application results, summarize early rankings
            return await self._summarize_early_phases(memory)
        elif context_type == "phase2_discussion":
            # Keep key group insights, compress individual experiences
            return await self._summarize_for_group_context(memory)
    return memory
```

#### B. Memory Compression Strategies
- **Selective Retention**: Keep only relevant memories for current context
- **Hierarchical Structure**: Use structured memory format instead of narrative
- **Smart Thresholds**: Dynamic character limits based on experiment phase

### 2. Prompt Template Optimization (20-30% cost reduction)

#### A. Dynamic Context Loading
```python
def _generate_dynamic_instructions(ctx, agent, config):
    """Generate minimal context-aware instructions."""
    # Only include relevant sections for current phase/round
    core_context = self._get_minimal_context(ctx)
    phase_instructions = self._get_targeted_instructions(ctx.phase, ctx.round_number)
    
    # Skip verbose explanations after Phase 1
    if ctx.phase == ExperimentPhase.PHASE_2:
        return self._get_phase2_minimal_template(core_context, phase_instructions)
    
    return self._get_phase1_template(core_context, phase_instructions)
```

#### B. Instruction Caching
- **Pre-computed Templates**: Cache common instruction combinations
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Reduce instruction verbosity as agents gain experience
- **Context-Specific**: Different templates for different experimental phases

### 3. Memory Update Elimination (15-25% cost reduction)

#### A. Selective Memory Updates
```python
# Only update memory for significant events
significant_events = [
    "phase1_ranking", 
    "phase1_application_with_payoff",
    "phase2_consensus_reached",
    "experiment_complete"
]

if event_type in significant_events:
    await self._update_agent_memory(agent, context, round_content)
```

#### B. Batch Memory Processing
- **End-of-phase Updates**: Single memory update at phase completion
- **Event-driven**: Only update when meaningful outcomes occur
- **Agent-initiated**: Let agents request memory updates when needed

### 4. Phase 2 Conversation Optimization (25-35% cost reduction)

#### A. Conversation Summarization
```python
async def _get_conversation_summary(self, full_history: str, participant_perspective: str) -> str:
    """Provide contextually relevant conversation summary instead of full history."""
    return await self.utility_agent.summarize_conversation(
        full_history=full_history,
        focus_on=["consensus_progress", "principle_preferences", "vote_proposals"],
        perspective=participant_perspective,
        max_length=1500  # Much smaller than full history
    )
```

#### B. Targeted Reasoning
- **Conditional Reasoning**: Only enable reasoning for complex decisions
- **Simplified Reasoning**: Use structured prompts instead of free-form reasoning
- **Reasoning Caching**: Reuse similar reasoning patterns

### 5. Utility Agent Efficiency (10-15% cost reduction)

#### A. Local Parsing for Simple Cases
```python
def _try_local_parsing(self, response: str) -> Optional[PrincipleChoice]:
    """Attempt local parsing before using LLM utility agent."""
    # Simple regex patterns for clear responses
    if match := re.search(r'I choose (?:principle )?([a-d])', response.lower()):
        principle_map = {'a': 'maximizing_floor', 'b': 'maximizing_average'}
        if principle := principle_map.get(match.group(1)):
            # Extract constraint amount if present
            constraint_match = re.search(r'\$(\d+(?:,\d+)*)', response)
            constraint = int(constraint_match.group(1).replace(',', '')) if constraint_match else None
            return PrincipleChoice(principle=principle, constraint_amount=constraint)
    return None  # Fall back to LLM parsing
```

#### B. Batch Processing
- **Group Validation**: Validate all participant responses in single LLM call
- **Pattern Recognition**: Use ML models for simple parsing tasks

## Conclusion

The proposed optimizations can achieve 40-70% cost reduction for participant agents while maintaining full experimental functionality. The phased implementation approach allows for gradual validation and risk mitigation. Priority should be given to memory management and prompt optimization as they offer the highest impact with manageable complexity.
