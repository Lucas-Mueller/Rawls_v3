# The Frohlich Experiment: A Multi-Agent AI System for Studying Distributive Justice

## Abstract

This document provides a comprehensive technical and theoretical analysis of a sophisticated multi-agent artificial intelligence system designed to replicate and extend the seminal Frohlich experiment on distributive justice. The system implements a rigorous two-phase experimental design that simulates human decision-making processes around principles of distributive justice, using large language model-based agents as experimental subjects. This implementation represents a novel application of multi-agent AI systems to empirical research in political philosophy and behavioral economics, offering new methodological approaches for studying collective decision-making and justice preferences in controlled experimental environments.

## 1. Introduction and Theoretical Framework

### 1.1 Background and Motivation

The Frohlich experiment, originally conducted by Norman Frohlich and Joe Oppenheimer, represents a foundational study in empirical political philosophy that investigates how individuals and groups reason about principles of distributive justice. The original experiment examined participants' preferences among different justice principles when they were placed behind a modified "veil of ignorance" - a concept central to John Rawls' theory of justice. This AI-based implementation extends the original experimental design by leveraging the cognitive capabilities of large language models to explore these fundamental questions about justice and fairness in a controlled, scalable, and reproducible manner.

The theoretical foundation of this system rests on several key premises: first, that artificial intelligence agents can serve as meaningful proxies for human reasoning about complex normative questions; second, that multi-agent interactions can simulate group deliberation and consensus-building processes; and third, that systematic variation in agent parameters (such as personality, reasoning capabilities, and decision-making temperature) can provide insights into the factors that influence justice preferences.

### 1.2 Justice Principles Framework

The experimental system is built around four distinct principles of distributive justice, each representing a different normative approach to income distribution:

**Principle A: Maximizing the Floor Income** - This principle embodies a Rawlsian maximin approach, prioritizing the welfare of the worst-off individuals in society. Under this principle, the most just distribution is that which maximizes the income of those at the bottom of the income distribution, regardless of its effects on overall social welfare or other income classes.

**Principle B: Maximizing Average Income** - Representing a utilitarian approach, this principle seeks to maximize total social welfare as measured by average income. This approach prioritizes overall economic efficiency and aggregate welfare over distributional concerns.

**Principle C: Maximizing Average Income with Floor Constraint** - This hybrid principle attempts to balance efficiency concerns with a minimum welfare guarantee. It seeks to maximize average income while ensuring that no individual falls below a specified minimum income threshold, requiring participants to specify the exact dollar amount of this constraint.

**Principle D: Maximizing Average Income with Range Constraint** - This principle combines efficiency maximization with inequality limitation by constraining the maximum allowable difference between the highest and lowest incomes. Participants must specify the maximum permissible income range in dollar terms.

## 2. System Architecture and Design

### 2.1 Overall System Architecture

The experimental system follows a modular, service-oriented architecture designed to facilitate scalability, maintainability, and experimental flexibility. The architecture separates concerns across several distinct layers:

**Configuration Layer**: The system employs a YAML-based configuration system built on Pydantic models that allows researchers to specify experimental parameters including agent characteristics, experimental duration, income distribution ranges, and language settings. This approach ensures reproducibility and enables systematic parameter variation across experimental conditions.

**Agent Management Layer**: The system supports multiple types of AI agents, each serving distinct roles within the experimental framework. Participant agents serve as experimental subjects, while utility agents provide specialized parsing and validation functions. The system supports heterogeneous agent configurations, allowing researchers to vary model providers, temperatures, personality traits, and reasoning capabilities across participants.

**Experimental Orchestration Layer**: The core experimental logic is managed by specialized phase managers that coordinate the complex sequence of individual and group interactions. The Phase 1 Manager handles parallel individual familiarization processes, while the Phase 2 Manager orchestrates sequential group discussions and consensus-building activities.

**Data Management Layer**: The system implements comprehensive logging and data collection mechanisms that capture agent-centric information including memory states, decision-making processes, earnings, and interaction histories. All experimental data is structured using Pydantic models to ensure type safety and facilitate downstream analysis.

**Error Handling and Recovery Layer**: Given the inherent unpredictability of large language model responses, the system implements sophisticated error detection, categorization, and recovery mechanisms that ensure experimental robustness while maintaining data integrity.

### 2.2 Agent Architecture and Capabilities

#### 2.2.1 Participant Agents

Participant agents represent the primary experimental subjects and are designed to simulate human decision-making processes around questions of distributive justice. Each participant agent is characterized by several key capabilities and attributes:

**Memory Management**: Each participant agent maintains a continuous, self-managed memory system with a configurable character limit (default 50,000 characters). This memory persists across both experimental phases and allows agents to accumulate experience, learning, and strategic insights throughout the experiment. The system employs agent-managed memory updates, where agents themselves decide what information to retain, how to structure their memories, and what lessons to draw from their experiences.

**Personality and Role Definition**: Agents are configured with specific personality profiles and role descriptions that influence their decision-making processes and interaction styles. The system supports rich personality customization, allowing researchers to explore how different character traits and backgrounds influence justice preferences and group dynamics.

**Dynamic Temperature Detection**: The system automatically detects and adapts to the temperature capabilities of different language models, ensuring that agent decision-making exhibits appropriate stochasticity. This feature is particularly important for simulating realistic human-like variability in responses while maintaining experimental control.

**Reasoning Capabilities**: Agents can be configured with different reasoning modes, including internal reasoning processes that occur before public statements in group discussions. This feature allows researchers to examine the relationship between private deliberation and public expression in collective decision-making contexts.

#### 2.2.2 Utility Agents

Utility agents serve specialized functions within the experimental framework, primarily focused on parsing and validating participant responses. These agents employ sophisticated natural language processing capabilities to:

**Response Parsing**: Extract structured information from free-text participant responses, including principle choices, constraint specifications, certainty levels, and reasoning explanations. The parsing system employs multiple strategies including regular expression patterns, semantic analysis, and large language model-based interpretation.

**Validation and Error Detection**: Validate that participant responses meet experimental requirements, particularly ensuring that participants who choose constraint-based principles (C or D) provide valid constraint amounts. The system implements retry mechanisms that re-prompt participants for valid responses when initial attempts are incomplete or invalid.

**Consensus Analysis**: Analyze group discussions and voting outcomes to determine whether consensus has been reached, employing both exact matching and semantic similarity approaches to accommodate natural language variations in participant responses.

### 2.3 Multi-Language Support

The system provides comprehensive multi-language support for English, Spanish, and Mandarin Chinese, enabling cross-cultural research on justice preferences. The language system includes:

**Localized Prompts**: All experimental prompts, instructions, and feedback messages are available in culturally appropriate translations that preserve the semantic content while adapting to linguistic and cultural contexts.

**Agent Language Consistency**: All participant agents in a given experiment operate in the same language, ensuring coherent group discussions and preventing language barriers from confounding experimental results.

**Cultural Adaptation**: The system accounts for cultural differences in numerical representation, politeness conventions, and communication styles while maintaining experimental validity across language conditions.

## 3. Experimental Procedure

### 3.1 Phase 1: Individual Familiarization and Learning

Phase 1 represents a comprehensive individual learning and decision-making phase designed to familiarize participant agents with the four justice principles through direct experience with their consequences. This phase consists of several distinct sub-phases that build understanding progressively:

#### 3.1.1 Initial Principle Ranking

Each participant agent begins the experiment by providing an initial ranking of the four justice principles from most preferred (rank 1) to least preferred (rank 4). This initial assessment captures baseline preferences before agents have experienced the practical consequences of different principles. Agents are required to provide certainty levels for their rankings, using a five-point scale ranging from "very unsure" to "very sure." This initial ranking serves as a baseline against which subsequent preference changes can be measured.

#### 3.1.2 Detailed Principle Explanation

Following initial ranking, agents receive comprehensive explanations of how each principle operates when applied to concrete income distributions. The system presents agents with example distribution tables showing five income classes (high, medium-high, medium, medium-low, and low) across four different distributions. Agents learn how each principle would select among these distributions, developing practical understanding of the principles' operational differences.

The system can operate in two distinct modes for this learning phase:

**Dynamic Generation Mode**: Income distributions are generated dynamically using configurable multiplier ranges applied to base distributions. This approach ensures that each experimental run uses unique distribution sets, reducing the possibility of memorization or strategic adaptation across experiments.

**Original Values Mode**: The system uses predefined distribution sets that correspond exactly to the original Frohlich experiment protocols. This mode enables direct replication studies and ensures comparability with historical experimental results.

#### 3.1.3 Principle Application Rounds

The core learning mechanism consists of four iterative rounds where agents apply their chosen principles to concrete distribution scenarios and experience the consequences of their decisions. In each round:

**Distribution Presentation**: Agents are presented with a set of four income distributions in tabular format, with incomes specified for each of the five income classes.

**Principle Selection**: Agents must choose one of the four justice principles to apply to the distributions. Agents selecting constraint-based principles (C or D) must specify exact constraint amounts in dollar terms.

**Outcome Determination**: The system applies the chosen principle to determine which distribution is selected, then randomly assigns the agent to one of the five income classes within that distribution according to configurable probability weights.

**Earnings Calculation**: Agents receive monetary earnings equal to $1 for every $10,000 of income in their assigned class, creating meaningful economic incentives that align with their distributional choices.

**Counterfactual Analysis**: After each round, agents receive detailed feedback showing what they would have earned under each alternative principle, fostering learning about the practical consequences of different justice approaches.

**Memory Integration**: Following each round, agents update their memory systems with information about their choices, outcomes, and lessons learned, building experiential knowledge that influences future decisions.

#### 3.1.4 Post-Learning Assessments

Phase 1 concludes with two additional ranking exercises that capture how agent preferences have evolved through direct experience:

**Post-Explanation Ranking**: Immediately after the detailed explanation phase, agents provide a second ranking to measure the effects of enhanced understanding on their preferences.

**Final Phase 1 Ranking**: After completing all four application rounds, agents provide a final ranking that reflects their accumulated experience with the practical consequences of different justice principles.

### 3.2 Phase 2: Group Discussion and Consensus Building

Phase 2 transforms the experiment from individual decision-making to collective deliberation, examining how agents negotiate and potentially reach consensus on group-binding justice principles. This phase is designed to simulate democratic deliberation processes while maintaining experimental control.

#### 3.2.1 Memory Continuity and Context Transition

A critical design feature of Phase 2 is the preservation of complete memory continuity from Phase 1. Each agent enters Phase 2 with their full experiential memory intact, including all earnings, decision rationales, and lessons learned from individual application rounds. This continuity ensures that group discussions are informed by prior experience rather than occurring in isolation.

The system updates agent contexts to reflect their transition to Phase 2 while maintaining bank balances from Phase 1, creating continuity in agent decision-making and ensuring that Phase 1 experiences influence Phase 2 behaviors.

#### 3.2.2 Group Discussion Mechanics

**Speaking Order Management**: The system generates randomized speaking orders for each discussion round while implementing constraints to prevent the same agent from starting consecutive rounds. This approach ensures balanced participation opportunities while maintaining natural conversation flow.

**Statement Generation and Validation**: When prompted for discussion contributions, agents can provide internal reasoning (if reasoning is enabled) followed by public statements. The system implements sophisticated validation mechanisms to ensure that agents provide meaningful contributions, with retry logic for empty or inadequate responses.

**Discussion State Management**: The system maintains comprehensive discussion state including public conversation history, statement sequences, and voting proposals. This state information is made available to all participants, ensuring that discussions build coherently on previous contributions.

**Vote Proposal and Agreement**: Any agent can propose that the group conduct a vote. However, voting only proceeds if all agents unanimously agree to vote, preventing premature consensus attempts and ensuring that voting reflects genuine group readiness.

#### 3.2.3 Voting and Consensus Mechanisms

The system implements a sophisticated secret ballot voting system with multiple consensus detection mechanisms:

**Secret Ballot Voting**: Each agent votes privately for their preferred principle, with constraint-based principles requiring specific constraint amount specifications. The system validates all votes to ensure completeness and coherence.

**Exact Consensus Detection**: The system first attempts to identify perfect consensus where all agents choose identical principles with identical constraint amounts. This strict matching ensures that consensus reflects genuine agreement rather than approximation.

**Semantic Consensus Analysis**: If exact consensus fails, the system employs semantic similarity analysis to identify near-consensus situations where agents choose the same principle with similar constraint amounts. The system uses configurable tolerance levels to determine whether constraint amounts are sufficiently similar to constitute consensus.

**Consensus Failure Handling**: If consensus cannot be achieved after the maximum number of discussion rounds, the system randomly assigns earnings to participants, creating incentives for successful group coordination.

#### 3.2.4 Payoff Determination and Final Rankings

**Principle Application**: When consensus is reached, the agreed-upon principle is applied to a new set of income distributions generated specifically for Phase 2. Each agent is randomly assigned to an income class and receives earnings based on their assignment.

**Random Assignment**: In cases where consensus fails, agents receive random assignments across different distributions, eliminating the benefits of coordinated principle selection.

**Final Preference Assessment**: Following payoff determination, all agents provide final principle rankings that reflect their complete experimental experience including both individual learning and group interaction phases.

## 4. Data Collection and Experimental Measurements

### 4.1 Comprehensive Logging Architecture

The system implements a sophisticated agent-centric logging architecture that captures all relevant experimental data while maintaining participant privacy and experimental integrity. The logging system is designed to facilitate both quantitative analysis of choice patterns and qualitative analysis of reasoning processes.

**Interaction Sequence Documentation**: All agent interactions, including discussion contributions, voting behaviors, and consensus-building activities, are logged with timestamps and context information.

#### 4.1.2 Experimental Metadata and Configuration Tracking

**Configuration Preservation**: Complete experimental configurations are embedded in results files, ensuring that all experimental conditions are documented and experiments can be replicated precisely.

**Agent Characteristic Documentation**: Detailed information about each agent's configuration, including model provider, temperature settings, personality traits, and reasoning capabilities, is preserved to enable analysis of how agent characteristics influence experimental outcomes.

**Language and Cultural Context**: For multi-language experiments, complete language configuration and cultural adaptation information is logged to support cross-cultural analysis.

### 4.2 Validation and Quality Assurance

#### 4.2.1 Response Validation Systems

**Constraint Specification Validation**: The system implements comprehensive validation for constraint-based principle choices, ensuring that agents provide valid dollar amounts for floor and range constraints and re-prompting when specifications are incomplete.

**Ranking Consistency Checks**: All principle rankings are validated for completeness and consistency, ensuring that agents provide valid orderings without ties or omissions.

**Statement Quality Assessment**: Group discussion contributions are validated for substantive content, with retry mechanisms for empty or meaningless responses.

#### 4.2.2 Error Detection and Recovery

**Communication Error Handling**: The system implements sophisticated error detection for agent communication failures, including timeout handling, parsing errors, and model availability issues.

**Memory Management Error Recovery**: When agents exceed memory limits, the system provides multiple retry opportunities for memory consolidation while preserving experimental continuity.

**Consensus Detection Validation**: The system employs multiple approaches to consensus detection and validates consensus determinations to prevent false positives or negatives in group agreement assessment.

## 9. Conclusion

This multi-agent AI system represents a sophisticated and novel approach to studying distributive justice and collective decision-making through computational methods. By carefully replicating and extending the classical Frohlich experimental design, the system provides researchers with powerful tools for exploring fundamental questions about justice, fairness, and social cooperation in controlled, scalable, and reproducible environments.

The system's comprehensive architecture, encompassing multi-agent coordination, sophisticated memory management, multi-language support, and rigorous experimental controls, demonstrates the potential for AI-based methods to contribute meaningfully to empirical research in political philosophy and behavioral economics. The dual-mode capabilities, supporting both historical replication and novel experimental conditions, position the system as a bridge between classical experimental traditions and emerging computational methodologies.

While important questions remain about the validity of AI agents as models for human moral reasoning and decision-making, this system provides a valuable platform for exploring these questions empirically. The comprehensive data collection capabilities, sophisticated error handling, and extensive configuration flexibility enable researchers to conduct rigorous studies that can advance our understanding of both human and artificial approaches to questions of distributive justice.

The implications of this work extend beyond the specific domain of distributive justice to broader questions about collective decision-making, democratic deliberation, and the design of fair institutions. As AI systems become increasingly prevalent in society, understanding how they approach questions of fairness and justice becomes crucial for ensuring that these systems align with human values and contribute positively to social welfare.

Future research using this system has the potential to generate new insights into longstanding philosophical questions while also contributing to the practical challenge of designing AI systems that can reason effectively about moral and ethical questions. The integration of rigorous experimental methods with advanced AI capabilities represents a promising direction for both theoretical research and practical applications in the intersection of technology, philosophy, and social science.
