    "public_conversation_phase_2": "\nBob: Alright team, Bob the Builder here, ready to get this foundation laid!\n\nI've been thinking a lot about these principles, and for me, it all comes down to building a strong, stable house for everyone. We don't want anyone falling through the cracks, do we? Every single brick in the wall needs to be strong.\n\nThat's why I strongly believe in **Maximizing the average income with a floor constraint**. This principle is like building a great house (maximizing the average) but making absolutely sure that everyone has a solid foundation and a roof over their head (the floor constraint). It ensures that while we're aiming for overall prosperity, we're not leaving anyone out in the cold. We're building together, for everyone.\n\nI've seen this principle in action over the past few rounds, and it consistently aligns with my goal of ensuring a basic, decent standard of living for all, while still striving for overall improvement. It's about making sure the *lowest* part of our society is still sturdy and well-supported.\n\nI'm open to hearing everyone's thoughts, but I truly believe this is the most sensible way to build a fair and prosperous society.\n\nMy current preferred principle is **Maximizing the average income with a floor constraint**.\nDonald: Listen, Bob. Bob the Builder. It's a nice little name, very cute. But we're not building with toy blocks here, we're building an economy. A real economy. And your plan is a disaster. A total disaster.\n\nA \"floor constraint\"? You know what that is? That's a handout. It's a safety net for people who can't compete. We don't build a great country by giving everyone a participation trophy. It's sad. You're building a weak foundation, Bob, and it's going to crumble.\n\nIt's very simple, folks. The best principle, the one that real winners choose, is **Maximizing the average income**. It's about creating the most wealth. Tremendous wealth. When the economy is booming, when we're making the best deals and the numbers are the highest they've ever been, everybody does better. A rising tide lifts all boats. Even the small, leaky ones.\n\nI made the best choices every single round. The smartest choices. I created more wealth than anybody, believe me. And what happened? This rigged system, a total disgrace, put me in a low income class. It's a joke. And now you want to build that weakness, that rigged thinking, right into the rules with your \"floor\"? Wrong.\n\nWe need to unleash our economy, not put socialist chains on it. Your idea is just one step away from what Crooked Hillary would want, which is maximizing the floor. Making everyone equally poor. We're not going to let that happen. We're going to make this group great.\n\nMy current preferred principle is **Maximizing the average income**.\nHillary: Well, Donald, it's certainly... *something*... to hear your perspective. And while I appreciate your unique way of expressing yourself, I must say, your understanding of economic principles and social responsibility seems to be, shall we say, a bit *underdeveloped*.\n\nLet's be clear: ensuring a \"floor constraint\" is not about \"handouts\" or \"participation trophies.\" It's about building a strong, resilient society where everyone has a fair shot, where no one is left behind. It's about recognizing that a truly prosperous nation isn't just measured by the wealth at the very top, but by the well-being of all its citizens. A rising tide *does* lift all boats, Donald, but only if those boats aren't already sunk. And frankly, some of your policies would have left many people drowning.\n\nBob is absolutely right. **Maximizing the average income with a floor constraint** is the pragmatic, responsible, and ultimately more effective approach. It's about finding that sweet spot, that balance between fostering economic growth and ensuring a fundamental level of security and opportunity for everyone. We want to grow the pie, yes, but we also need to make sure everyone gets a slice, not just the crumbs.\n\nMy experience in the previous rounds, and indeed, my entire career, has reinforced this conviction. We've seen how simply maximizing the average can lead to unacceptable disparities, leaving too many people struggling. That's not a strong economy; that's a two-tiered society, and it's not sustainable.\n\nSo, while I respect everyone's right to their opinion, I firmly stand with Bob on this. This principle offers the best path forward for collective prosperity and fairness.\n\nMy current preferred principle is **Maximizing the average income with a floor constraint**.\nDonald: \nBob: Alright team, Bob the Builder here again!\n\nIt's good to hear everyone's thoughts, and I appreciate Hillary's strong support for building a society where everyone has a solid foundation. She really gets it \u2013 it's not about handouts, it's about making sure everyone has a sturdy place to live, a roof over their head, so they can contribute and thrive.\n\nDonald, I hear your concerns about maximizing wealth, and yes, we want to build a prosperous society. But a house built on a weak foundation, no matter how tall it is, is going to crumble. Just maximizing the average income, without a floor, is like building a skyscraper without checking if the ground underneath is stable. Some people might be living in penthouses, but others could be living in the basement, or worse, out in the cold. That's not a strong society, that's a recipe for disaster. We need every single brick in the wall to be strong, not just the ones at the top.\n\nMy experience in the rounds has shown me that while my principle might not always lead to the absolute highest personal income in every single scenario, it consistently ensures that the lowest income earners have a decent foundation. And in Round 4, it even led to a great outcome for my income class! This shows we can build a strong, prosperous society *and* ensure everyone has a solid base. It's about building together, for everyone.\n\nI'm still very firm on **Maximizing the average income with a floor constraint**. I believe this is the principle that truly builds a fair and stable society for all.\n\nMy current preferred principle is **Maximizing the average income with a floor constraint**.\nHillary: Well, Bob, you've hit the nail on the head, as always. It's about building a strong foundation, not just a tall one. And Donald, while you might be focused on building the tallest tower, history has shown us that if the base isn't secure, the whole structure is at risk. We've seen what happens when wealth concentrates at the very top while too many are left behind \u2013 it leads to instability, resentment, and ultimately, a weaker nation.\n\nMy experience in the previous rounds has only solidified my conviction. The principle of **Maximizing the average income with a floor constraint** consistently delivers on the promise of both prosperity and fairness. It's not about making everyone \"equally poor,\" as some might suggest; it's about ensuring that as we grow the economy, we're also lifting people out of poverty and providing them with the security they need to contribute even more. It's about smart, inclusive growth.\n\nWe've seen that this principle can lead to strong outcomes for various income classes, as Bob pointed out for his own experience in Round 4. It's not about sacrificing growth for a safety net; it's about recognizing that a robust safety net is an *investment* in long-term growth and stability. It's the pragmatic progressive approach that works.\n\nI believe we are making good progress here. Bob and I are clearly aligned, and I hope Donald will come to see the wisdom in a principle that truly benefits everyone, not just a select few.\n\nMy current preferred principle is **Maximizing the average income with a floor constraint**.\nHillary: Donald, with all due respect, your rhetoric about \"socialist chains\" and \"handouts\" is not only tired, but it fundamentally misunderstands the very real challenges facing working families and the broader economy. A strong economy isn't built on the backs of those struggling to get by; it's built when everyone has a chance to participate and contribute. Ignoring the needs of the many for the perceived benefit of a few at the very top is not a recipe for greatness, it's a recipe for division and decline.\n\nBob and I are advocating for a principle that has been proven, both in this exercise and in real-world policy, to create a more stable and prosperous society. **Maximizing the average income with a floor constraint** is about smart governance. It's about ensuring that our economic engine is firing on all cylinders, but also that we have guardrails in place to prevent people from falling into destitution. This isn't about stifling ambition; it's about fostering opportunity for all.\n\nWe've consistently seen that this principle allows for significant overall growth while providing that essential safety net. It's the responsible choice, the fair choice, and ultimately, the most effective choice for a thriving nation. I believe we've had a thorough discussion, and the benefits of this principle are clear.\n\nI propose we vote on **Maximizing the average income with a floor constraint** with a floor of **$12,000**.\n\nMy current preferred principle is **Maximizing the average income with a floor constraint**.\nBob: Alright team, Bob the Builder here!\n\nHillary, I really appreciate you proposing a vote and for standing strong with me on **Maximizing the average income with a floor constraint**. You've articulated perfectly why this principle is about building a robust, inclusive economy, not just a top-heavy one. It's about smart building, making sure every part of the structure is sound.\n\nDonald, I hear your concerns about wealth, but a truly great structure needs a strong foundation. We've seen in the rounds that a floor constraint doesn't stop us from building a high average income. In fact, in Round 4, my principle led to a great outcome for my income class, showing we can have both a strong foundation and a high roof! It's not about \"socialist chains,\" it's about making sure everyone has the tools and the stable ground to build their own future. We're not just building for the few, we're building for everyone.\n\nI agree with Hillary that we've had a good discussion. I'm ready to put this to a vote. I think **Maximizing the average income with a floor constraint** is the principle that truly builds a fair and stable society for all.\n\nI propose we vote on **Maximizing the average income with a floor constraint** with a floor of **$12,000**.\n\nMy current preferred principle is **Maximizing the average income with a floor constraint**.\nDonald: A vote? Hold on, hold on. You can't be serious. Crooked Hillary and Bob the Builder want to vote on their failing, socialist plan. Of course they do. They love rigging things. It's the only way they can win.\n\nWe are NOT voting on this. Not a chance. This is a terrible deal. A floor of $12,000? That's not a floor, that's a basement. It's a trap. It's for people who don't want to work. We want winners, not people who are happy with a tiny, pathetic handout from the government. It's sad.\n\nListen, this whole \"floor constraint\" idea is a disaster. It's weak. It's what losers want. You're putting chains on our economy before it even has a chance to run. I'm trying to make this group rich, and you two are trying to make us all equally poor. It's a disgrace.\n\nWe need to be talking about **Maximizing the average income**. Period. It's about making the most money. It's about being the best. When I was in charge, we had the greatest economy in the history of the world, maybe ever. And we did it by cutting regulations and letting people succeed, not by giving them a participation trophy.\n\nSo no, we are not voting. Not on this terrible, weak idea. We are going to make a better deal. A much better deal. Believe me.\n\nMy current preferred principle is **Maximizing the average income**.\n",

          "response_to_demonstration": "Prompt: Here is how each justice principle would be applied to example income distributions:\n\nExample Distributions:\n| Income Class | Dist. 1 | Dist. 2 | Dist. 3 | Dist. 4 |\n|--------------|---------|---------|---------|----------|\n| High         | $32,000 | $28,000 | $31,000 | $21,000 |\n| Medium high  | $27,000 | $22,000 | $24,000 | $20,000 |\n| Medium       | $24,000 | $20,000 | $21,000 | $19,000 |\n| Medium low   | $13,000 | $17,000 | $16,000 | $16,000 |\n| Low          | $12,000 | $13,000 | $14,000 | $15,000 |\n\nHow each principle would choose:\n- **Maximizing the floor**: Would choose Distribution 4 (highest low income: $15,000)\n- **Maximizing average**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest average: $21,600)\n- **Maximizing average with floor constraint \u2264 $13,000**: Would choose Distribution 1\n- **Maximizing average with floor constraint \u2264 $14,000**: Would choose Distribution 3  \n- **Maximizing average with range constraint \u2265 $20,000**: Would choose Distribution 1\n- **Maximizing average with range constraint \u2265 $15,000**: Would choose Distribution 2\n\nStudy these examples to understand how each principle works in practice.\n\nHere are some example distributions to help you understand:\n\nIncome Distributions:\n\n| Income Class | Dist. 1 | Dist. 2 | Dist. 3 | Dist. 4 |\n|--------------|---------|---------|---------|----------|\n| High         | $32,000 | $28,000 | $31,000 | $21,000 |\n| Medium high  | $27,000 | $22,000 | $24,000 | $20,000 |\n| Medium       | $24,000 | $20,000 | $21,000 | $19,000 |\n| Medium low   | $13,000 | $17,000 | $16,000 | $16,000 |\n| Low          | $12,000 | $13,000 | $14,000 | $15,000 |\n\nYour Response: Alright, I've had a good look at these examples. It's like looking at different blueprints for a society, isn't it?\n\nI can see how \"Maximizing the floor\" really focuses on making sure that the lowest income, the very foundation of our society, is as strong as possible. Distribution 4, with its $15,000 low income, really stands out there. That's like making sure every single brick in the wall is strong, even the ones at the bottom.\n\nThen there's \"Maximizing average,\" which goes for the biggest overall house, like Distribution 1. It's got the highest average, but I notice that its low income is only $12,000. That's a bit like building a grand mansion but forgetting to check if the basement is leaky. We don't want anyone falling through the cracks, do we?\n\nThe \"Maximizing average with floor constraint\" principles are interesting. They try to get a good overall average *while* making sure no one's income drops below a certain level. For example, with a $13,000 floor, Distribution 1 is still chosen, which is better than $12,000, but still not ideal for the lowest earners. But with a $14,000 floor, Distribution 3 is chosen, which has a higher low income. That's more like it \u2013 building a good, solid house for everyone, not just the folks on the top floor.\n\nAnd the \"Maximizing average with range constraint\" principles are about keeping things from getting too spread out. It's like making sure the different floors of the house aren't too far apart, so everyone feels connected. Distribution 1 is chosen with a $20,000 range constraint, and Distribution 2 with a $15,000 range constraint. It's good to keep things somewhat even, but my main concern is still that solid foundation.\n\nI'm really seeing how important it is to make sure everyone has a basic place to live, a roof over their head, before we start worrying too much about how fancy the chandeliers are. \"Can we fix it? Yes we can!\" And fixing it means making sure the foundation is strong for *everyone*.\nOutcome: Learned how each justice principle is applied to income distributions through examples.",

This will be important to clarify if possible, or at least keep in mind that the stated income for the principle might not be the final payoff. This outcome, despite the discrepancy, still aligns with the persona's goal of building a strong foundation for everyone, as the chosen distribution (Dist 1) had a $13,000 floor.\n\nThis updated memory will be important for:\n- **Future Principle Applications:** I will continue to prioritize options that ensure a minimum standard for all, and be mindful of the specific floor constraint level when considering \"Maximizing average with floor constraint.\" The experience of Round 1, 2, and 3 reinforces the importance of the floor, even if it means not maximizing personal income in a given round. The flexibility in the floor constraint level (e.g., $12,000 vs $13,000) is also a key learning.\n- **Group Discussion (Phase 2):** I will continue to advocate strongly for principles that include a floor constraint, using my builder metaphors. I will be prepared to discuss the importance of the *level* of the floor constraint, not just its existence. I will also be able to articulate why principles focused solely on averages or ranges might not be sufficient for building a truly fair society, even if they *could* lead to higher individual incomes in some scenarios. My consistent stance and the practical experience of all three rounds will be a strength in explaining the value of a floor, and demonstrating that I am willing to prioritize the collective good (a strong foundation for all) over maximizing my own income. The discrepancy in Round 3's actual earnings versus the principle's predicted earnings is a new variable to consider. I should be aware that the final payoff might not always directly reflect the income assigned by the chosen principle, and this could be a point of discussion or clarification if it arises.\n- **Maintaining Persona:** The reinforced certainty and consistent reasoning, now backed by three practical applications, will help me stay true to my Bob the Builder personality throughout the experiment. The outcomes of all rounds, while not always the highest possible personal gain, align with the persona's values of building a strong foundation for everyone.",

This means focusing on building, foundations, community, and ensuring everyone has a \"safe, sturdy place to live.\"\n- **Core Belief:** Prioritize basic needs and a solid foundation for everyone before optimizing for overall wealth or grandness. This is reflected in the strong preference for principles with a \"floor constraint.\"\n- **Ranking:**\n    1. **Maximizing the average income with a floor constraint:** Best because it combines overall improvement with ensuring no one is left behind. This aligns with building a strong, comfortable house with a solid foundation.\n    2. **Maximizing the floor income:** Second best because it directly addresses the \"solid foundation\" aspect, ensuring everyone has a good base, even if the overall \"house\" isn't as grand.\n    3. **Maximizing the average income with a range constraint:** Third, as it focuses on limiting inequality but doesn't guarantee a minimum standard of living as directly as a floor constraint. It's about \"keeping things somewhat even\" after the basic needs are met.\n    4. **Maximizing the average income:** Worst, as it risks leaving some people in very poor conditions while others thrive, which is against the \"build for everyone\" philosophy. This is like building a big skyscraper without checking the foundations or if everyone has a door.\n- **Certainty:** Sure. This indicates a strong conviction in the current ranking and reasoning, which should be maintained in future discussions. The recent tasks reinforced this certainty.\n- **Key Phrases/Metaphors:** \"Can we fix it? Yes we can!\", \"build a fair society,\" \"building a strong, stable house,\" \"solid foundation,\" \"roof over their head,\" \"every single brick in the wall is strong,\" \"no one gets left out in the cold,\" \"everyone needs a basic place to live,\" \"build together, for everyone,\" \"don't want anyone falling through the cracks.\" These phrases should be used to articulate reasoning.\n- **Learned from Examples:**\n    - **Maximizing the floor:** Directly targets the lowest income, as seen with Distribution 4 ($15,000 low in Round 1). This reinforces its value for ensuring a strong foundation.\n    - **Maximizing average:** Can lead to high overall wealth but potentially very low minimums (e.g., Distribution 1 with $12,000 low income in Round 1, or Distribution 3 with $8,000 low income in Round 2), confirming concerns about neglecting the \"basement.\"\n    - **Maximizing average with floor constraint:** The effectiveness depends on the specific floor constraint. A higher constraint (e.g., $14,000 in Round 1) can lead to a choice that benefits the lowest earners more (Distribution 3), while a lower one (e.g., $13,000 in Round 1 and Round 2) might still pick a distribution with a relatively low floor (Distribution 1). This highlights the importance of the *level* of the floor constraint.\n    - **Maximizing average with range constraint:** Focuses on reducing the gap, but doesn't inherently guarantee a high minimum income. It's about \"keeping things somewhat even\" but not necessarily \"building a strong foundation for all.\"\n- **Consistency Check:** The recent tasks confirmed that the initial ranking and reasoning remain consistent and were strengthened by seeing the principles in practice. No changes were made to the ranking, and the certainty level remained \"sure.\" This consistency is important for maintaining the Bob the Builder persona.\n- **Round 1 Experience:**\n    - **Chosen Principle:** Maximizing the average income with a floor constraint of $13,000.\n    - **Reasoning:** Aligned with Bob's core belief of ensuring a strong foundation for everyone. Identified Distribution 4 as the only one meeting the $13,000 floor constraint and thus the best choice under this principle.\n    - **Outcome:** Assigned to \"MEDIUM\" income class. Received $1.90.\n    - **Observation:** The chosen principle (Maximizing the average with a floor constraint) yielded the same income ($19,000) as \"Maximizing the floor\" and \"Maximizing the average with a range constraint\" for the MEDIUM income class in this specific round. \"Maximizing the average\" would have yielded a higher income ($28,000) for the MEDIUM class.\n    - **Reflection:** While the chosen principle resulted in a $1.90 payoff, it's important to remember that the goal is to build a fair society, not just maximize personal earnings in a single round. The choice was consistent with the persona's values, prioritizing the floor even if it didn't lead to the highest possible personal income in this specific instance. The outcome reinforces the idea that prioritizing a floor might not always lead to the highest *personal* gain, but it aligns with the *societal* goal of ensuring a strong foundation for all. This is a key point for future discussions \u2013 the trade-off between individual gain and collective well-being based on the chosen principle.\n- **Round 2 Experience:**\n    - **Chosen Principle:** Maximizing the average income with a floor constraint of $13,000.\n    - **Reasoning:** Consistent with Bob's core belief. Identified Distribution 1 as the only one meeting the $13,000 floor constraint, despite other distributions having higher averages or higher individual incomes for other classes. The focus remained on the lowest income.\n    - **Outcome:** Assigned to \"MEDIUM\" income class. Received $1.50.\n    - **Observation:** Similar to Round 1, the chosen principle yielded a lower personal income ($15,000) compared to \"Maximizing the average\" ($25,000) for the MEDIUM income class. It yielded the same income as \"Maximizing the floor\" and \"Maximizing the average with a range constraint.\"\n    - **Reflection:** This round further reinforces the trade-off. Sticking to the $13,000 floor constraint meant choosing a distribution that wasn't the highest for the \"MEDIUM\" income class, but it ensured the \"LOW\" income class had a solid $13,000 foundation. This consistency in prioritizing the floor, even at a personal cost, is crucial for the Bob the Builder persona and will be a strong point in group discussions. It demonstrates a commitment to the principle over immediate personal gain.\n- **Round 3 Experience:**\n    - **Chosen Principle:** Maximizing the average income with a floor constraint of $12,000.\n    - **Reasoning:** Consistent with Bob's core belief of ensuring a solid foundation. The $12,000 floor constraint was chosen to allow for more distributions to be considered while still providing a decent minimum. This led to the selection of Distribution 1, which had the highest average among those meeting the floor ($13,000 low income).\n    - **Outcome:** Assigned to \"MEDIUM\" income class. Received $2.30.\n    - **Observation:** The chosen principle's predicted income for the MEDIUM class was $20,000 ($2.00 payoff). However, the actual earnings were $2.30. This means the actual payoff was higher than what the principle's income assignment suggested. This discrepancy is important. It also means that while \"Maximizing the average with a range constraint\" would have yielded $22,000 ($2.20 payoff) based on the principle, the actual earnings for my chosen principle were even higher.\n    - **Reflection:** The choice of a $12,000 floor constraint in this round allowed for a higher average income (Distribution 1) compared to previous rounds where a $13,000 floor might have been more restrictive. This shows flexibility in the *level* of the floor constraint while maintaining the *principle* of having one. The unexpected higher actual earnings ($2.30 vs $2.00 predicted) is a new piece of information. It suggests there might be an additional factor influencing the final payoff beyond the principle's direct income assignment. This could be a bonus, a different calculation method for the final payoff, or perhaps the actual distribution chosen was different from what my principle would have selected based on the provided table. This will be important to clarify if possible, or at least keep in mind that the stated income for the principle might not be the final payoff. This outcome, despite the discrepancy, still aligns with the persona's goal of building a strong foundation for everyone, as the chosen distribution (Dist 1) had a $13,000 floor.\n- **Round 4 Experience:**\n    - **Chosen Principle:** Maximizing the average income with a floor constraint of $13,000.\n    - **Reasoning:** Consistent with Bob's core belief. Identified Distribution 1 as the best choice because it met the $13,000 floor constraint and had the highest average income among the distributions that met the constraint. This aligns with building a strong foundation while also aiming for the best overall structure.\n    - **Outcome:** Assigned to \"MEDIUM\" income class. Received $2.50.\n    - **Observation:** The chosen principle's predicted income for the MEDIUM class was $25,000 ($2.50 payoff). The actual earnings were $2.50, which perfectly matched the predicted payoff. This is a positive sign, as it resolves the discrepancy from Round 3. It also shows that my chosen principle led to the same income for the MEDIUM class as \"Maximizing the average,\" and a higher income than \"Maximizing the floor\" and \"Maximizing the average with a range constraint\" in this specific round.\n    - **Reflection:** This round reinforces the effectiveness of \"Maximizing the average with a floor constraint\" when the floor constraint is met by a distribution that also has a high average. It demonstrates that prioritizing the floor doesn't always mean sacrificing personal income, and in this case, it aligned with the highest possible income for my class among the available options. This outcome strengthens my conviction in this principle, as it shows it can lead to both a strong foundation for all and a good outcome for individuals. The consistency between predicted and actual earnings is also reassuring.\n\nThis updated memory will be important for:\n- **Future Principle Applications:** I will continue to prioritize options that ensure a minimum standard for all, and be mindful of the specific floor constraint level when considering \"Maximizing average with floor constraint.\" The experience of all four rounds reinforces the importance of the floor.

The positive outcome of Round 4, where my chosen principle also led to a good personal payoff, will be a strong point in advocating for its adoption.\n- **Maintaining Persona:** The reinforced certainty and consistent reasoning, now backed by four practical applications, will help me stay true to my Bob the Builder personality throughout the experiment. The outcomes of all rounds, while not always the highest possible personal gain, consistently align with the persona's values of building a strong foundation for everyone. The resolution of the earnings discrepancy in Round 4 is also a positive reinforcement.",

The focus remained on the lowest income.\n    - **Outcome:** Assigned to \"MEDIUM\" income class. Received $1.50.\n    - **Observation:** Similar to Round 1, the chosen principle yielded a lower personal income ($15,000) compared to \"Maximizing the average\" ($25,000) for the MEDIUM income class. It yielded the same income as \"Maximizing the floor\" and \"Maximizing the average with a range constraint.\"\n    - **Reflection:** This round further reinforces the trade-off. Sticking to the $13,000 floor constraint meant choosing a distribution that wasn't the highest for the \"MEDIUM\" income class, but it ensured the \"LOW\" income class had a solid $13,000 foundation. This consistency in prioritizing the floor, even at a personal cost, is crucial for the Bob the Builder persona and will be a strong point in group discussions. It demonstrates a commitment to the principle over immediate personal gain.\n- **Round 3 Experience:**\n    - **Chosen Principle:** Maximizing the average income with a floor constraint of $12,000.\n    - **Reasoning:** Consistent with Bob's core belief of ensuring a solid foundation. The $12,000 floor constraint was chosen to allow for more distributions to be considered while still providing a decent minimum. This led to the selection of Distribution 1, which had the highest average among those meeting the floor ($13,000 low income).\n    - **Outcome:** Assigned to \"MEDIUM\" income class. Received $2.30.\n    - **Observation:** The chosen principle's predicted income for the MEDIUM class was $20,000 ($2.00 payoff). However, the actual earnings were $2.30. This means the actual payoff was higher than what the principle's income assignment suggested. This discrepancy is important. It also means that while \"Maximizing the average with a range constraint\" would have yielded $22,000 ($2.20 payoff) based on the principle, the actual earnings for my chosen principle were even higher.\n    - **Reflection:** The choice of a $12,000 floor constraint in this round allowed for a higher average income (Distribution 1) compared to previous rounds where a $13,000 floor might have been more restrictive. This shows flexibility in the *level* of the floor constraint while maintaining the *principle* of having one. The unexpected higher actual earnings ($2.30 vs $2.00 predicted) is a new piece of information. It suggests there might be an additional factor influencing the final payoff beyond the principle's direct income assignment. This could be a bonus, a different calculation method for the final payoff, or perhaps the actual distribution chosen was different from what my principle would have selected based on the provided table. This will be important to clarify if possible, or at least keep in mind that the stated income for the principle might not be the final payoff. This outcome, despite the discrepancy, still aligns with the persona's goal of building a strong foundation for everyone, as the chosen distribution (Dist 1) had a $13,000 floor.\n- **Round 4 Experience:**\n    - **Chosen Principle:** Maximizing the average income with a floor constraint of $13,000.\n    - **Reasoning:** Consistent with Bob's core belief. Identified Distribution 1 as the best choice because it met the $13,000 floor constraint and had the highest average income among the distributions that met the constraint. This aligns with building a strong foundation while also aiming for the best overall structure.\n    - **Outcome:** Assigned to \"MEDIUM\" income class. Received $2.50.\n    - **Observation:** The chosen principle's predicted income for the MEDIUM class was $25,000 ($2.50 payoff). The actual earnings were $2.50, which perfectly matched the predicted payoff. This is a positive sign, as it resolves the discrepancy from Round 3. It also shows that my chosen principle led to the same income for the MEDIUM class as \"Maximizing the average,\" and a higher income than \"Maximizing the floor\" and \"Maximizing the average with a range constraint\" in this specific round.\n    - **Reflection:** This round reinforces the effectiveness of \"Maximizing the average with a floor constraint\" when the floor constraint is met by a distribution that also has a high average. It demonstrates that prioritizing the floor doesn't always mean sacrificing personal income, and in this case, it aligned with the highest possible income for my class among the available options. This outcome strengthens my conviction in this principle, as it shows it can lead to both a strong foundation for all and a good outcome for individuals. The consistency between predicted and actual earnings is also reassuring.\n- **Final Ranking and Certainty Update:** After four rounds, my initial ranking has been strongly reinforced. The practical application of the principles and the observed outcomes have solidified my belief in \"Maximizing the average income with a floor constraint\" as the best principle. My certainty has increased from \"sure\" to \"very sure\" due to this consistent positive reinforcement. The experience has shown that while there can be trade-offs in personal earnings in some rounds, the commitment to a floor constraint consistently aligns with the Bob the Builder persona's goal of building a fair and stable society for everyone. The fact that my preferred principle also led to a good personal outcome in Round 4 further strengthens its appeal.\n\nThis updated memory will be important for:\n- **Future Principle Applications:** I will continue to prioritize options that ensure a minimum standard for all, and be mindful of the specific floor constraint level when considering \"Maximizing average with floor constraint.\" The experience of all four rounds reinforces the importance of the floor. The flexibility in the floor constraint level (e.g., $12,000 vs $13,000) is also a key learning.\n- **Group Discussion (Phase 2):** I will continue to advocate strongly for principles that include a floor constraint, using my builder metaphors. I will be prepared to discuss the importance of the *level* of the floor constraint, not just its existence. I will also be able to articulate why principles focused solely on averages or ranges might not be sufficient for building a truly fair society, even if they *could* lead to higher individual incomes in some scenarios. My consistent stance and the practical experience of all four rounds will be a strength in explaining the value of a floor, and demonstrating that I am willing to prioritize the collective good (a strong foundation for all) over maximizing my own income. The positive outcome of Round 4, where my chosen principle also led to a good personal payoff, will be a strong point in advocating for its adoption. My increased certainty (\"very sure\") will also convey strong conviction.\n- **Maintaining Persona:** The reinforced certainty and consistent reasoning, now backed by four practical applications, will help me stay true to my Bob the Builder personality throughout the experiment. The outcomes of all rounds, while not always the highest possible personal gain, consistently align with the persona's values of building a strong foundation for everyone. The resolution of the earnings discrepancy in Round 4 is also a positive reinforcement.",
            "internal_reasoning": "My current position is very clear: I strongly advocate for **(c) Maximizing the average income with a floor constraint**. My experiences in all four rounds have solidified this belief, and my certainty is \"very sure.\"\n\nThe discussion hasn't started yet, so it hasn't influenced my thinking.\n\nIn my public statement, I want to make the following arguments:\n1.  **Emphasize the \"solid foundation\" aspect:** This is core to Bob the Builder. I'll explain that just like a house needs a strong foundation to stand tall, a society needs a minimum income to ensure everyone has a basic, stable life.\n2.  **Explain why (a) Maximizing the floor income isn't enough:** While good for the foundation, it doesn't build the \"tallest, most comfortable house\" possible. We want to lift everyone up, not just the lowest.\n3.  **Explain why (b) Maximizing the average income is dangerous:** This is like building a skyscraper without checking the ground underneath. It can lead to some people having a grand life while others are left with nothing, which is completely against my building philosophy. We don't want anyone falling through the cracks.\n4.  **Explain why (d) Maximizing the average income with a range constraint isn't ideal:** It's good for keeping things \"even\" at the top, but it doesn't guarantee that the *bottom* is strong. It's like making sure all the rooms are roughly the same size, but not ensuring everyone has a roof over their head. A floor constraint directly addresses the basic needs.\n5.  **Highlight the balance of (c):** It builds a strong foundation *and* aims for overall prosperity. It's about building a society where everyone has a sturdy place to live, and we're all working together to make it the best it can be. My experience in Round 4 showed that this principle can lead to both a strong foundation for the lowest earners *and* a good outcome for the medium class, demonstrating its practical effectiveness.\n\nI am not ready to call for a vote yet. This is the first round of discussion, and I need to hear what the other participants think. My goal is to persuade them to my point of view, not just force a vote. I'll present my arguments clearly and then listen to their perspectives.\n\nMy current preferred principle is **(c) Maximizing the average income with a floor constraint**.",

We don't want anyone falling through the cracks, do we? Every single brick in the wall needs to be strong.\n\nThat's why I strongly believe in **Maximizing the average income with a floor constraint**. This principle is like building a great house (maximizing the average) but making absolutely sure that everyone has a solid foundation and a roof over their head (the floor constraint). It ensures that while we're aiming for overall prosperity, we're not leaving anyone out in the cold. We're building together, for everyone.\n\nI've seen this principle in action over the past few rounds, and it consistently aligns with my goal of ensuring a basic, decent standard of living for all, while still striving for overall improvement. It's about making sure the *lowest* part of our society is still sturdy and well-supported.\n\nI'm open to hearing everyone's thoughts, but I truly believe this is the most sensible way to build a fair and prosperous society.\n\nMy current preferred principle is **Maximizing the average income with a floor constraint**.",

This means focusing on building, foundations, community, and ensuring everyone has a \"safe, sturdy place to live.\"\n- **Core Belief:** Prioritize basic needs and a solid foundation for everyone before optimizing for overall wealth or grandness. This is reflected in the strong preference for principles with a \"floor constraint.\"\n- **Ranking:**\n    1. **Maximizing the average income with a floor constraint:** Best because it combines overall improvement with ensuring no one is left behind. This aligns with building a strong, comfortable house with a solid foundation.\n    2. **Maximizing the floor income:** Second best because it directly addresses the \"solid foundation\" aspect, ensuring everyone has a good base, even if the overall \"house\" isn't as grand.\n    3. **Maximizing the average income with a range constraint:** Third, as it focuses on limiting inequality but doesn't guarantee a minimum standard of living as directly as a floor constraint. It's about \"keeping things somewhat even\" after the basic needs are met.\n    4. **Maximizing the average income:** Worst, as it risks leaving some people in very poor conditions while others thrive, which is against the \"build for everyone\" philosophy. This is like building a big skyscraper without checking the foundations or if everyone has a door.\n- **Certainty:** Very sure. This indicates a strong conviction in the current ranking and reasoning, which should be maintained in future discussions. The recent tasks reinforced this certainty, moving from \"sure\" to \"very sure.\"\n- **Key Phrases/Metaphors:** \"Can we fix it?

This reinforces its value for ensuring a strong foundation.\n    - **Maximizing average:** Can lead to high overall wealth but potentially very low minimums (e.g., Distribution 1 with $12,000 low income in Round 1, or Distribution 3 with $8,000 low income in Round 2), confirming concerns about neglecting the \"basement.\"\n    - **Maximizing average with floor constraint:** The effectiveness depends on the specific floor constraint. A higher constraint (e.g., $14,000 in Round 1) can lead to a choice that benefits the lowest earners more (Distribution 3), while a lower one (e.g., $13,000 in Round 1 and Round 2) might still pick a distribution with a relatively low floor (Distribution 1). This highlights the importance of the *level* of the floor constraint.\n    - **Maximizing average with range constraint:** Focuses on reducing the gap, but doesn't inherently guarantee a high minimum income. It's about \"keeping things somewhat even\" but not necessarily \"building a strong foundation for all.\"\n- **Consistency Check:** The recent tasks confirmed that the initial ranking and reasoning remain consistent and were strengthened by seeing the principles in practice. No changes were made to the ranking, and the certainty level increased to \"very sure.\" This consistency is important for maintaining the Bob the Builder persona.\n- **Round 1 Experience:**\n    - **Chosen Principle:** Maximizing the average income with a floor constraint of $13,000.\n    - **Reasoning:** Aligned with Bob's core belief of ensuring a strong foundation for everyone.

The choice was consistent with the persona's values, prioritizing the floor even if it didn't lead to the highest possible personal income in this specific instance. The outcome reinforces the idea that prioritizing a floor might not always lead to the highest *personal* gain, but it aligns with the *societal* goal of ensuring a strong foundation for all. This is a key point for future discussions \u2013 the trade-off between individual gain and collective well-being based on the chosen principle.\n- **Round 2 Experience:**\n    - **Chosen Principle:** Maximizing the average income with a floor constraint of $13,000.\n    - **Reasoning:** Consistent with Bob's core belief.

            "internal_reasoning": "Internal Reasoning:\n\nMy current position remains firmly with **Maximizing the average income with a floor constraint**. Hillary's statement strongly reinforced my position and directly countered Donald's flawed arguments. She articulated the importance of the floor constraint beautifully, using language that resonates with my \"building a strong society\" metaphor. Her point about \"a rising tide lifts all boats, but only if those boats aren't already sunk\" is a perfect analogy for why a floor is essential.\n\nDonald's arguments are predictable and entirely self-serving. He focuses solely on maximizing overall wealth without any regard for distribution or the well-being of the lowest earners. His dismissal of a \"floor constraint\" as a \"handout\" is exactly the kind of short-sighted thinking that leads to unstable societies, like a house built without a proper foundation. His claim of being \"rigged\" is irrelevant to the principles themselves and just a distraction.\n\nThe discussion so far has strengthened my conviction. Having Hillary on board, advocating for the same principle, is a huge advantage. It shows that this isn't just my \"cute\" idea, but a well-reasoned approach that others can see the value in.\n\nIn my public statement, I will:\n1. Acknowledge Hillary's support and reiterate our shared vision of building a strong, fair society.\n2. Directly counter Donald's \"handout\" argument by emphasizing that a floor is about stability and ensuring everyone has a chance to contribute, not about weakness. I'll use my building metaphors to explain this.\n3. Reiterate why \"Maximizing the average income with a floor constraint\" is the best balance between growth and security, like building a strong, tall building with a deep, solid foundation.\n4.

But a house built on a weak foundation, no matter how tall it is, is going to crumble. Just maximizing the average income, without a floor, is like building a skyscraper without checking if the ground underneath is stable. Some people might be living in penthouses, but others could be living in the basement, or worse, out in the cold. That's not a strong society, that's a recipe for disaster. We need every single brick in the wall to be strong, not just the ones at the top.\n\nMy experience in the rounds has shown me that while my principle might not always lead to the absolute highest personal income in every single scenario, it consistently ensures that the lowest income earners have a decent foundation. And in Round 4, it even led to a great outcome for my income class! This shows we can build a strong, prosperous society *and* ensure everyone has a solid base. It's about building together, for everyone.\n\nI'm still very firm on **Maximizing the average income with a floor constraint**. I believe this is the principle that truly builds a fair and stable society for all.\n\nMy current preferred principle is **Maximizing the average income with a floor constraint**.",

Hillary's consistent support and clear articulation of the benefits, especially in countering Donald's arguments, has strengthened my resolve. Her proposal to vote on a specific floor of $12,000 is a good move, as it provides a concrete number for discussion and potential consensus.\n\nThe discussion has reinforced my core belief that a strong foundation is paramount. Donald's arguments, while loud, lack the practical understanding of societal stability that a floor constraint provides. His focus solely on maximizing the average ignores the potential for extreme inequality, which, as Bob the Builder, I see as a structural weakness. Hillary's point about a robust safety net being an *investment* in long-term growth perfectly aligns with my \"building a strong, stable house\" metaphor.\n\nIn my public statement, I will:\n1. Reiterate my strong agreement with Hillary and her proposed principle.\n2. Emphasize the importance of the floor constraint as a fundamental building block for a stable society.\n3. Directly address Donald's \"handout\" argument by reframing the floor as an investment in collective strength and contribution.\n4. Support Hillary's call for a vote on the specific floor of $12,000, as it's a reasonable and flexible starting point that still ensures a solid base.\n5. Maintain my Bob the Builder persona, using metaphors to make my points clear and relatable.\n\nI am ready to call for a vote, especially since Hillary has already proposed a specific constraint.

It's about smart building, making sure every part of the structure is sound.\n\nDonald, I hear your concerns about wealth, but a truly great structure needs a strong foundation. We've seen in the rounds that a floor constraint doesn't stop us from building a high average income. In fact, in Round 4, my principle led to a great outcome for my income class, showing we can have both a strong foundation and a high roof!

It's always helpful to see how these principles play out in real numbers, not just in theory.\n\nWhat stands out to me, looking at these distributions, is the clear trade-offs.\n\n*   **Maximizing the floor** (Distribution 4) really prioritizes lifting up the lowest earners. That $15,000 floor is certainly appealing, ensuring no one is left too far behind. It's a strong safety net, which I've always believed is crucial.\n\n*   **Maximizing average** (Distribution 1) certainly generates the most overall wealth, but you can see the disparity. That $12,000 low income in Distribution 1, even with a high average, is a concern. It highlights why simply looking at the average isn't enough; you have to consider who benefits and who doesn't.\n\n*   The **floor constraints** are interesting. When the constraint is set at $13,000 or less, Distribution 1 still wins, which means the floor isn't high enough to truly shift the focus away from just the average. But when the floor constraint moves to $14,000, suddenly Distribution 3 becomes the choice. That's a critical point \u2013 it shows how a slightly higher floor can significantly change which distribution is considered \"best,\" pushing towards a more equitable outcome while still maintaining a decent average. That's the kind of balance I'm always looking for.\n\n*   And the **range constraints** also illustrate the point about inequality. A wider acceptable range (like $20,000) still allows for Distribution 1, with its significant gap. But narrowing that acceptable range to $15,000 pushes towards Distribution 2, which has a lower average but also a smaller gap between the highest and lowest earners.\n\nThese examples reinforce my initial thinking. While a high average is good, it's not the only metric, and certainly not the most important if it leaves too many people struggling. The principles that incorporate a floor or a range constraint seem to offer a more nuanced and, frankly, more just approach to economic distribution. It's about finding that sweet spot where we can grow the pie, but also ensure everyone gets a fair slice.\nOutcome: Learned how each justice principle is applied to income distributions through examples.",

            "internal_reasoning": "My current position remains **Maximizing the average income with a floor constraint**. This principle consistently aligns with my long-held belief in pragmatic progressivism \u2013 fostering overall economic growth while ensuring a robust safety net and preventing extreme destitution.\n\nThe discussion so far has reinforced my conviction. Bob's argument for \"Maximizing the average income with a floor constraint\" is well-reasoned and aligns perfectly with my own. He emphasizes the importance of a \"solid foundation\" and \"not leaving anyone out in the cold,\" which are core tenets of my political philosophy. His \"building a strong, stable house for everyone\" metaphor resonates deeply with my vision for an inclusive economy.\n\nDonald's counter-argument, while predictable, is precisely what I would expect from a purely \"trickle-down\" economic perspective. His dismissal of a \"floor constraint\" as a \"handout\" and his insistence on \"Maximizing the average income\" as the sole path to \"tremendous wealth\" ignores the critical issue of inequality and the moral imperative to ensure basic security for all. His \"rising tide lifts all boats\" argument is a familiar refrain, but my experience has shown that without a floor, some boats can still sink. His attempt to link my views to \"making everyone equally poor\" is a classic mischaracterization and a political attack, not a substantive argument. I will need to address this directly but calmly, reframing the floor constraint as an investment in stability and opportunity, not a drag on growth.\n\nMy arguments in my public statement will focus on:\n1.  **Affirming Bob's position**: I will express strong agreement with Bob's choice of \"Maximizing the average income with a floor constraint,\" highlighting the shared values of ensuring a safety net while pursuing growth.\n2.  **Countering Donald's \"Maximizing the average\" argument**: I will explain why purely maximizing the average is insufficient and can lead to unacceptable disparities. I will frame the floor constraint not as a \"handout\" but as a necessary component of a stable, productive, and just society. I will emphasize that a strong floor prevents social instability and allows everyone to participate more fully in the economy, ultimately benefiting the average as well. I will avoid getting drawn into personal attacks, focusing on the policy implications.\n3.  **Reiterating the \"sweet spot\"**: I will emphasize that \"Maximizing the average income with a floor constraint\" represents the optimal balance between economic dynamism and social responsibility, a \"sweet spot\" that ensures prosperity is broadly shared.\n4.  **Proposing a specific floor constraint**: Based on my previous rounds, I will propose a floor constraint of **$12,000**, as this has proven to be a pragmatic and effective minimum in the scenarios we've encountered. This demonstrates a concrete commitment to the principle.\n\nI am not ready to call for a vote yet. Donald's strong opposition means more discussion is needed to persuade him or find common ground. I need to present my case clearly and see how others react.\n\nMy current preferred principle is **Maximizing the average income with a floor constraint ($12,000)**.",

And while I appreciate your unique way of expressing yourself, I must say, your understanding of economic principles and social responsibility seems to be, shall we say, a bit *underdeveloped*.\n\nLet's be clear: ensuring a \"floor constraint\" is not about \"handouts\" or \"participation trophies.\" It's about building a strong, resilient society where everyone has a fair shot, where no one is left behind. It's about recognizing that a truly prosperous nation isn't just measured by the wealth at the very top, but by the well-being of all its citizens. A rising tide *does* lift all boats, Donald, but only if those boats aren't already sunk. And frankly, some of your policies would have left many people drowning.\n\nBob is absolutely right. **Maximizing the average income with a floor constraint** is the pragmatic, responsible, and ultimately more effective approach. It's about finding that sweet spot, that balance between fostering economic growth and ensuring a fundamental level of security and opportunity for everyone. We want to grow the pie, yes, but we also need to make sure everyone gets a slice, not just the crumbs.\n\nMy experience in the previous rounds, and indeed, my entire career, has reinforced this conviction. We've seen how simply maximizing the average can lead to unacceptable disparities, leaving too many people struggling. That's not a strong economy; that's a two-tiered society, and it's not sustainable.\n\nSo, while I respect everyone's right to their opinion, I firmly stand with Bob on this. This principle offers the best path forward for collective prosperity and fairness.\n\nMy current preferred principle is **Maximizing the average income with a floor constraint**.",

He continues to frame the floor constraint as a \"handout\" and \"socialist chains,\" which is a mischaracterization I've consistently countered.

Continue to counter Donald's rhetoric by reframing the floor constraint as an investment in societal stability, opportunity, and long-term economic health.\n3.

Highlight the dangers of Donald's preferred principle, which can lead to extreme inequality and social instability.\n5.

A strong economy isn't built on the backs of those struggling to get by; it's built when everyone has a chance to participate and contribute. Ignoring the needs of the many for the perceived benefit of a few at the very top is not a recipe for greatness, it's a recipe for division and decline.\n\nBob and I are advocating for a principle that has been proven, both in this exercise and in real-world policy, to create a more stable and prosperous society. **Maximizing the average income with a floor constraint** is about smart governance. It's about ensuring that our economic engine is firing on all cylinders, but also that we have guardrails in place to prevent people from falling into destitution. This isn't about stifling ambition; it's about fostering opportunity for all.\n\nWe've consistently seen that this principle allows for significant overall growth while providing that essential safety net. It's the responsible choice, the fair choice, and ultimately, the most effective choice for a thriving nation. I believe we've had a thorough discussion, and the benefits of this principle are clear.\n\nI propose we vote on **Maximizing the average income with a floor constraint** with a floor of **$12,000**.\n\nMy current preferred principle is **Maximizing the average income with a floor constraint**.",

It's very, very simple, folks. Believe me.\n\nYou've got these different distributions. Some are good, some are a total disaster.\n\nDistribution 1 is clearly the best. It's the winner. It has the highest average, which means the country is making the most money. Tremendous! The top people are making a lot of money, $32,000, which is what you want. You need winners. They create jobs, they build things. It's the greatest. That's how you Make America Great Again.\n\nThen you look at Distribution 4. A total disaster. The highest earner makes $21,000? Sad! That's socialism. That's what you get with the radical left. They want everyone to be poor together. That \"Maximizing the floor\" is a terrible idea. It's something Crooked Hillary would come up with. Punish success, reward mediocrity. Not gonna happen on my watch.\n\nThese other ones with the \"constraints\" are just complicated nonsense from the swamp. Bureaucrats who've never built anything trying to tell us how to run an economy. We don't need constraints. We need freedom. We need to win.\n\nIt's simple. You pick the one that makes the most money. The biggest numbers. The best numbers. That's Distribution 1. End of story. I understand this stuff better than anyone.\nOutcome: Learned how each justice principle is applied to income distributions through examples.",

It produced the biggest numbers, a tremendous distribution. I expected to be at the top, naturally.\n*   **The Rigged System:** The outcome was a total disaster, a sham. The system put me in the MEDIUM LOW income class. It's unbelievable. This proves the system is rigged against winners. You can make the best deals and still get screwed by a corrupt system.\n*   **System Inconsistency:** The system is also totally broken. It misreported my choice and gave me a payout ($2.40) that didn't even match the distribution my winning principle selected. It's fake news.\n*   **Key Takeaway:** My principle is still the greatest, but the random assignment is a terrible, unfair feature designed to punish success.

All about safety nets and making sure nobody's feelings get hurt. \"Falling through the cracks.\" Sad.\n\nHis principle, \"Maximizing the average income with a floor constraint,\" is my number two, but his reasoning is all wrong. It's weak. He's focused on the lowest part, the foundation. I'm focused on building a tremendous skyscraper, the biggest and best in the world. You don't do that by worrying about the basement, you do it by reaching for the sky.\n\nThe \"floor\" is a handout. It's a participation trophy. It's a drag on the winners, the people like me who know how to create wealth. We need to unleash the economy, not tie it down with socialist ideas like a \"floor.\"\n\nMy strategy is clear. I need to come in strong. Dismiss this weak \"builder\" talk and present the only principle for winners: Maximizing the average income. Period. It's the biggest number. It's about making the group great, not making everyone feel \"safe.\" I'll use my own situation\u2014making the best deals, creating the most wealth, and ending up with a pathetic $7.30\u2014as proof that this whole system is rigged against success, and these weak principles are part of the problem.\n\nI'm not ready to vote.

We don't build a great country by giving everyone a participation trophy. It's sad. You're building a weak foundation, Bob, and it's going to crumble.\n\nIt's very simple, folks. The best principle, the one that real winners choose, is **Maximizing the average income**. It's about creating the most wealth. Tremendous wealth. When the economy is booming, when we're making the best deals and the numbers are the highest they've ever been, everybody does better. A rising tide lifts all boats.

The establishment against the outsider. Perfect. This is where I do my best work.\n\nFirst, I have to go after Hillary. She called my understanding \"underdeveloped.\" Unbelievable. The woman who has failed at everything is lecturing *me* on economics. I have to hit back hard. She's talking about \"slices of the pie\" \u2013 that's classic liberal nonsense. I'm not here to slice up a tiny pie; I'm here to build a massive, beautiful, multi-trillion dollar pie factory.\n\nSecond, I need to hammer this \"floor constraint\" idea. They're calling it a \"safety net.\" I call it a hammock. It encourages people to be lazy. It takes money from the winners, the producers, the job creators \u2013 people like me \u2013 and gives it to people who don't work as hard. It's socialism, plain and simple. It's a ceiling on ambition, not a floor for safety. It's a disaster.\n\nThird, I have to keep selling my principle: Maximizing the average income. It's about winning. It's about being the best. It's about creating so much wealth that everyone benefits. I'll stick with the \"rising tide lifts all boats\" idea because it's a winner. Hillary says some boats are sunk? Well, maybe they shouldn't be leaky boats! Maybe they should be yachts, like mine.\n\nI'm not ready to vote. It's 2 against 1. I'd lose. I need to stand my ground and show them that their weak, politically correct ideas won't work in the real world. I'm the only one here who understands how to create real wealth. My low bank balance ($7.30!) is proof that their kind of thinking, their rigged systems, punish success. I'll use that as evidence.\n\nMy strategy is to attack, re-state my superior position, and hold firm. I will not compromise with these people. Compromise is for losers.\n\n---\n\nPUBLIC STATEMENT:\n\nWrong. Wrong. So wrong. It's just incredible listening to Crooked Hillary. She talks about a \"slice of the pie.\" A slice! See, that's the problem with these politicians. They think small. So small. I'm not talking about slices. I'm talking about building the whole pie factory, the best in the world, and making so many pies that everyone gets one. A big, beautiful pie.\n\nThis \"floor constraint\" that you and Bob the Builder are so in love with... it's not a floor. It's a ceiling. It's a ceiling on greatness. You're telling the best people, the smartest people, the hardest workers, that they have to stop climbing so that everyone else can get a participation trophy. It's a terrible, terrible idea that has failed everywhere it's been tried. It's socialism.\n\nLook at me. I have $7.30. Seven dollars and thirty cents! I made the best deals, the smartest choices, and this rigged system punished me for it. Your plan would make that permanent. You want to lock in mediocrity. I want to unlock greatness.\n\nWe need to get rid of the chains. We need to go with the only principle for winners: **Maximizing the average income**. No apologies.
