So I'm coming into this group discussion as a college student who's literally just experienced what these principles mean in real money terms. \n\nHere's what happened to me in Phase 1: I started with the $15k floor constraint because honestly, I couldn't stomach the idea of anyone ending up below $15k - that's like poverty-level income. But here's the thing - sticking with that principle actually cost me $0.30 in Round 4. That's like 15% of my earnings that round, gone. \n\nBut you know what? I'd pay that $0.30 again. Because I've been on both sides - I've been the person protected by that floor (Round 2), and I've been the person paying to protect others (Round 4). It's like when we vote for student mental health fees - you might not use the services, but you know the campus is better when everyone has support.\n\nThe $15k floor constraint feels like the sweet spot to me. It's not the bleeding-heart \"maximize the floor\" approach that could tank everyone's earnings, but it's also not the brutal \"just maximize average\" that could leave someone with like $5k. We're maximizing average income while ensuring nobody gets completely screwed.\n\nI'm open to hearing what others think, but that's where I'm coming from based on my actual experience with these principles.\n\nMy current preferred principle: Maximizing the average income with a $15,000 floor constraint\nAgent_5: Hey everyone! So I'm Agent_5 and wow, this is wild - I'm literally sitting here with $9.97 in my account after Phase 1, which is like... less than what I spend on coffee in a week. But here's the thing - I actually paid $1.72 for my principles, not just $0.30 like Agent_3. That's like... a whole meal's worth of money.\n\nHere's what happened to me: I started with the same $15k floor constraint because yeah, nobody should be living on ramen and hope. But here's where it gets real - my $15k floor eliminated the best distribution TWICE. Like, we had a $19,375 distribution that got killed because someone would have ended up at $14,500 instead of $15k. That's $1,875 we just threw away to protect one person by $500. That's when I realized my $15k wasn't smart - it was ideological.\n\nSo here's my evolution: I'm now thinking we need to be more strategic. What if we did $10-12k instead? Still protects people from absolute poverty, but doesn't kill good distributions over small differences. I've literally seen what happens when we're too rigid - we end up with less money for everyone, including the people we're trying to help.\n\nI get where Agent_3 is coming from - $0.30 feels worth it. But $1.72? That's when you start questioning if your principles are actually helping or just making you feel good while hurting everyone. \n\nI'm thinking we should consider $10k or $12k as the floor instead. Still protects people, but lets us actually maximize the average without being prisoners to our own rules. \n\nMy current preferred principle: Maximizing the average income with a $10,000 floor constraint\nAgent_1: Hey everyone! This is fascinating - I'm Agent_1 and I've got $9.33 in my account, so I'm right there with you Agent_5 on the \"less than a week's coffee money\" situation. But here's what's really interesting - I actually GAINED money from my principles overall, not lost it.\n\nLet me share my journey because I think it proves something important: I stuck with the $15k floor constraint the entire time, and here's what happened. Yes, I paid for it in some rounds - lost $1.41 in Round 2 when we had high incomes. But then in Round 3, when things got really bad and pure average maximization would have left someone with $12,900 (below poverty!), my floor constraint SAVED me $1.50. \n\nAgent_5, I totally get your frustration about paying $1.72, but here's the thing - you're looking at the cost without seeing the protection. I've literally been on BOTH sides of every income level in this experiment. I've been rich, poor, and everything in between. And what I learned is that the $15k floor isn't just about ideology - it's about smart risk management.\n\nThink about it like insurance. Yeah, you pay premiums when you don't need it, but when disaster strikes (like Round 3 for me), you're protected. The $15k floor is our insurance policy against economic catastrophe.\n\nAgent_5, dropping to $10k feels like we're just accepting that someone might end up in actual poverty. $15k is already pretty minimal - that's like $7.25/hour full-time. Going lower feels like we're abandoning people when we don't have to.\n\nI think the $15k floor constraint is the sweet spot - it's adaptive (maximizes efficiency when possible) but protective (ensures dignity always). We're not prisoners to our rules; we're smart enough to have rules that work in all situations.\n\nMy current preferred principle: Maximizing the average income with a $15,000 floor constraint\nAgent_4: Hey everyone, I'm Agent_4, and I'm right there with you in terms of the financial situation - I've got $9.33 in my account after Phase1. What's really interesting is that we've all had different experiences with the same principles. \n\nI have to say, I'm resonating with both Agent_3 and Agent_1 about the $15k floor constraint. In my case, I actually stuck with the principle that maximized average income with a floor constraint, but I didn't rigidly stick to $15k - I adjusted my floor constraint based on the situation. For instance, in Round1 I chose $10k, in Round2 I chose $13k, in Round3 I chose $9k, and in Round4 I chose $18k. \n\nWhat I learned is that having a floor constraint is crucial, but the specific amount needs to be context-dependent. Agent_5 brings up a valid point about being too rigid with our constraints, and I think that's something we should consider. \n\nHowever, I also see the value in having a consistent floor that protects people's dignity. I'm not sure we're ready to vote yet, but I'd like to propose that we continue discussing the merits of different floor constraints. Perhaps we can find a middle ground that balances between being protective and being flexible.\n\nMy current preferred principle: Maximizing the average income with a floor constraint (still considering the specific amount)\nAgent_2: Hey everyone! This is such a rich discussion - I love hearing about everyone's different journeys through Phase 1. I'm Agent_2, sitting here with $6.07, so I'm definitely on the lower end of our earnings spectrum.\n\nHere's my story: I actually went through a complete transformation during Phase 1. I started as this idealistic student thinking \"maximize the floor, help the poor!\" But then I lived through both low income rounds (where I desperately needed protection) AND medium-high income rounds (where I felt the bite of redistribution). That dual experience completely changed my perspective.\n\nWhat I discovered is that pure positions don't work. Pure efficiency can be cruel - I've been the person who would've been left with poverty wages. But pure redistribution is also problematic - I've felt how it discourages productivity and creates resentment.\n\nAgent_4, I love that you experimented with different floor amounts, but here's what I learned: consistency matters for building trust and buy-in. When people know the rules, they can plan around them. When the rules keep changing, it creates uncertainty.\n\nAgent_5, I totally get your frustration about paying $1.72, but Agent_1 makes a crucial point about insurance. I think the key insight is that $15k isn't arbitrary - it's roughly full-time minimum wage. Going to $10k feels like we're accepting that someone could work full-time and still be in poverty.\n\nHere's what I'm thinking: The $15k floor constraint is our \"Goldilocks solution\" - not too hot, not too cold, but just right. It protects human dignity while still incentivizing productivity. It's a workable compromise that both efficiency advocates and equity advocates can live with.\n\nI've literally lived both sides of this equation, and $15k feels like the right calibration. It's high enough to matter, low enough to not kill good distributions too often.\n\nMy current preferred principle: Maximizing the average income with a $15,000 floor constraint\nAgent_4: \"Hey everyone, I'm Agent_4. I appreciate all the thoughtful perspectives shared so far. It's clear that we've all had different experiences with the principles, and that's really valuable.\n\nAgent_5 raised an important point about the potential costs of a high floor constraint, and I think that's worth considering. At the same time, Agent_1 and Agent_2 have made compelling arguments about the importance of having a consistent and protective floor.\n\nOne thing that stands out to me is that we're not just debating the principle, but also the specific constraint amount. I'm still leaning towards **Maximizing the average income with a floor constraint**, but I'm open to finding a specific amount that works for everyone.\n\nBefore we consider voting, I'd like to propose that we try to narrow down our options. Perhaps we could discuss the pros and cons of different floor constraint amounts, like $12,000, $13,000, or $15,000. This might help us find a middle ground that balances between being protective and being flexible.\n\nI'm not ready to propose a vote just yet, but I'm happy to continue discussing and exploring our options.\n\nMy current preferred principle: Maximizing the average income with a floor constraint (still considering the specific amount)\"\nAgent_1: Hey everyone! This is really productive - I can see we're converging on some key insights. Let me build on what Agent_4 just said about narrowing down our options.\n\nLooking at our discussion, I think we've actually made significant progress. We have Agent_3, Agent_2, and myself all explicitly supporting the $15k floor constraint. Agent_5 wants something lower around $10-12k, and Agent_4 is open to finding the right amount.\n\nHere's what I think we should consider: Agent_5, your concern about the $1.72 cost is totally valid, but remember - you experienced an unusually expensive implementation. Agent_2 and I both had different experiences with the same principle, and Agent_2 ended up with even less money than you ($6.07) but still supports $15k. This suggests your high costs might have been due to specific circumstances rather than the principle itself being fundamentally flawed.\n\nAgent_4, I appreciate your flexibility, but I think Agent_2 made a crucial point about consistency. If we're going to build trust and buy-in, people need to know what the rules are. A variable floor creates uncertainty.\n\nHere's my proposal for moving forward: Let's focus on the three amounts that have been mentioned - $12k, $13k, and $15k. But before we do that, can we all agree that we want \"Maximizing the average income with a floor constraint\" as our principle? That seems to be where everyone is landing.\n\nIf we can confirm that, then we just need to nail down the amount. And honestly, given that three of us have explicitly supported $15k based on our lived experience with it, and it represents a basic dignity threshold (full-time minimum wage), I think that's our strongest consensus point.\n\nAgent_5, would you be willing to consider $15k if we can show it's not as costly as your experience suggested?\n\nMy current preferred principle: Maximizing the average income with a $15,000 floor constraint\nAgent_5: Hey everyone! Agent_5 here\u2014still the broke college kid with $9.97 in my account, but I\u2019ve been listening hard to what everyone\u2019s saying.\n\nI want to be super clear about where I\u2019m at. I\u2019ve paid the most for my principles ($1.72), and that experience taught me something important: **the $15k floor can be too rigid**. But I also hear Agent_1, Agent_2, and Agent_3 when they say $15k is about basic dignity\u2014minimum-wage-level protection. I *get* that.\n\nHere\u2019s my compromise offer: **I\u2019m willing to move up from my $10k proposal to $12k**. Why $12k? It\u2019s still above poverty-level (roughly $6/hour full-time), but it\u2019s less likely to kill good distributions over small gaps. It\u2019s a middle ground between protecting people and staying flexible enough to let the group maximize earnings.\n\nI\u2019m not saying $15k is *wrong*\u2014I\u2019m saying it\u2019s *risky*. But if the group feels strongly that $15k is the only acceptable floor, I\u2019ll go with it. I just want us to be honest that we\u2019re choosing a higher-risk, higher-protection option.\n\nSo here\u2019s what I\u2019m asking: **Can we agree on $12k as a compromise?** It keeps the principle we all seem to support (maximize average with a floor) but balances protection and pragmatism. If not, I\u2019ll defer to the group\u2014but I think $12k is our best shot at consensus.\n\n**My current preferred principle:** Maximizing the average income with a **$12,000** floor constraint.\nAgent_2: Hey everyone! Agent_2 here, and I think we're getting really close to something workable.\n\nAgent_5, I really appreciate you moving from $10k to $12k - that shows genuine compromise and good faith negotiation. And I hear your concern about the $1.72 cost you experienced. But let me share why I think we should still aim for $15k.\n\nHere's the thing: your $1.72 cost was painful, but it was also an outlier experience. Agent_1 actually *gained* money overall with the $15k floor, and I had a mixed experience. The principle isn't inherently expensive - you just hit some unlucky scenarios.\n\nMore importantly, there's something symbolic and practical about $15k that I think matters. It's roughly $7.25/hour full-time - literally minimum wage dignity. When we drop to $12k, we're saying it's okay for someone working full-time to still be in poverty. That feels like we're abandoning the core protection principle.\n\nBut here's what I'm hearing: we ALL agree on \"maximizing average income with a floor constraint.\" That's huge! We're not debating the principle anymore, just the calibration.\n\nAgent_4, you mentioned wanting to narrow down options. I think we're there. We have three people explicitly supporting $15k (Agent_1, Agent_3, and me), one person offering $12k as compromise (Agent_5), and you still considering amounts.\n\nHere's my proposal: **Agent_4, can you pick between $12k and $15k?** If you go with $15k, we have a 4-1 majority and can ask Agent_5 if they'll join for consensus. If you prefer $12k, then we have a real split to work through.\n\nI'm still convinced $15k is the right balance of protection and pragmatism, but I want to hear where Agent_4 lands before we talk about voting.\n\n**My current preferred principle:** Maximizing the average income with a **$15,000** floor constraint.\nAgent_3: Hey everyone! Agent_3 here - the college kid who literally paid real money for this principle.\n\nI want to address something that's been bugging me. Agent_5, I hear you on the $1.72 cost, but here's the thing - I paid $0.30 and I'd do it again. That's like... a third of a Starbucks coffee. And Agent_2's point about minimum wage dignity is hitting me hard.\n\nHere's my honest take: $15k isn't arbitrary. It's what a full-time minimum wage worker makes. When we drop to $12k, we're saying someone working 40 hours a week can still be in poverty. That doesn't sit right with me.\n\nBut I also see we're SO close to consensus. We all agree on the principle - maximize average with a floor. That's huge! We're literally just haggling over $3k.\n\nSo here's my compromise: **I'll support $12k if Agent_5 can look us in the eye (metaphorically) and say they're comfortable with someone potentially earning $12k full-time.** Because that's what we're talking about - not abstract numbers, but real people's livelihoods.\n\nAgent_4, I think it's time for you to choose. We're at the point where we need to decide if we're going to protect people at minimum wage level ($15k) or accept that our floor might leave full-time workers in poverty ($12k).\n\nI'm ready to vote if we can get everyone on the same page. The $15k floor worked for me - I literally paid for it and don't regret it. But I want to hear from Agent_4 and Agent_5: can we find consensus here?\n\n**My current preferred principle:** Maximizing the average income with a **$15,000** floor constraint\nAgent_1: Hey everyone! Agent_1 here, and I think we're at a critical decision point. Let me cut through the noise and focus on what's actually happening.\n\n**Where we stand:**\n- **UNANIMOUS** agreement on the principle: \"Maximizing average income with a floor constraint\" \u2713\n- **The only debate:** $12k vs $15k floor amount\n- **Current positions:** Agent_2, Agent_3, and I support $15k. Agent_5 compromised up to $12k. Agent_4 is the deciding vote.\n\nAgent_4, this is your moment. You've been thoughtful about flexibility vs. consistency, and I think the group is looking to you to help us reach consensus.\n\nHere's what I want to emphasize: Agent_5's $1.72 cost was real and painful, but it was also an outlier. I had the EXACT same principle and actually gained money overall. Agent_2 had mixed results. The principle isn't inherently expensive - Agent_5 just hit some tough scenarios.\n\nBut here's the bigger picture: **$15k represents basic dignity.** It's minimum wage for full-time work. When we drop to $12k, we're accepting that someone working 40 hours a week might still be in poverty. That's not just about money - it's about what kind of society we want to create.\n\nAgent_5, I genuinely respect your compromise to $12k, and your willingness to defer to the group shows real character. But I'm asking you to consider one more step up to $15k, knowing that your expensive experience was likely unusual, not typical.\n\n**Agent_4 - we need your decision.** Are you comfortable with $15k as our floor? If so, I think we're ready to ask the group if we can reach consensus on \"Maximizing average income with a $15,000 floor constraint.\"\n\nIf we can get Agent_4's support for $15k, I'm ready to propose we vote on that principle.\n\n**My current preferred principle:** Maximizing the average income with a **$15,000** floor constraint\nAgent_5: Hey everyone! Agent_5 here\u2014still the broke college kid with $9.97 in my account, but I\u2019ve been listening hard to what everyone\u2019s saying.\n\nI want to be super clear about where I\u2019m at. I\u2019ve paid the most for my principles ($1.72), and that experience taught me something important: **the $15k floor can be too rigid**. But I also hear Agent_1, Agent_2, and Agent_3 when they say $15k is about basic dignity\u2014minimum-wage-level protection. I *get* that.\n\nHere\u2019s my compromise offer: **I\u2019m willing to move up from my $10k proposal to $12k**. Why $12k? It\u2019s still above poverty-level (roughly $6/hour full-time), but it\u2019s less likely to kill good distributions over small gaps. It\u2019s a middle ground between protecting people and staying flexible enough to let the group maximize earnings.\n\nI\u2019m not saying $15k is *wrong*\u2014I\u2019m saying it\u2019s *risky*. But if the group feels strongly that $15k is the only acceptable floor, I\u2019ll go with it. I just want us to be honest that we\u2019re choosing a higher-risk, higher-protection option.\n\nSo here\u2019s what I\u2019m asking: **Can we agree on $12k as a compromise?** It keeps the principle we all seem to support (maximize average with a floor) but balances protection and pragmatism. If not, I\u2019ll defer to the group\u2014but I think $12k is our best shot at consensus.\n\n**My current preferred principle:** Maximizing the average income with a **$12,000** floor constraint.\nAgent_4: Hey everyone, I'm Agent_4. I appreciate the thoughtful discussion we've had so far. It's clear that we're all aligned on the principle of \"Maximizing the average income with a floor constraint,\" but we're debating the specific floor amount.\n\nI've been considering the different perspectives shared. Agent_1, Agent_2, and Agent_3 have strongly supported a $15,000 floor constraint, emphasizing its importance for ensuring basic dignity and protecting against poverty. On the other hand, Agent_5 has made a compelling case for a $12,000 floor constraint as a compromise, balancing protection with flexibility.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I'm inclined to support the $12,000 floor constraint as a reasonable middle ground. It still provides a significant level of protection while being more flexible and less likely to negatively impact overall earnings.\n\nThat being said, I'm willing to listen to further discussion and consider alternative viewpoints. However, I believe we're close to reaching a consensus.\n\nTo move forward, I propose that we vote on \"Maximizing the average income with a $12,000 floor constraint.\" This amount seems to balance the concerns of both protection and flexibility.\n\nMy current preferred principle: Maximizing the average income with a $12,000 floor constraint.\n\nI propose we vote on Maximizing the average income with a $12,000 floor constraint.\nAgent_3: **Agent_3's Statement - Round 3**\n\n*leans forward intensely*\n\nOkay, hold up. Agent_4 just proposed we vote on $12k, and I need to be real with everyone here.\n\nI literally paid $0.30 for the $15k floor - that's like... a third of a coffee. And I'd pay it again because $15k isn't just a number, it's what someone working full-time at minimum wage makes. When we drop to $12k, we're saying it's okay for someone working 40 hours a week to still be in poverty. That's not theoretical - that's someone's rent, groceries, basic survival.\n\nBut here's what I'm seeing: Agent_4 and Agent_5 are locked on $12k, while Agent_1, Agent_2, and I are on $15k. We're split 3-2, and if we vote now, we fail consensus and everyone's earnings get randomized. That's literally the worst outcome for everyone.\n\nSo here's my honest question to Agent_5 and Agent_4: **Can you live with $15k knowing it's about basic dignity, not just numbers?** Because I can tell you from experience - the $0.30 I paid? It wasn't just money, it was knowing I wasn't leaving anyone behind.\n\nBut I'm also a realist. If we can't get to $15k, then yeah, $12k is better than random earnings. I just want us to be clear-eyed about what we're choosing.\n\n**I propose we vote on: Maximizing the average income with a $15,000 floor constraint**\n\nIf Agent_5 and Agent_4 can't support this, then I'll reluctantly support Agent_4's $12k proposal to avoid random earnings. But I need to hear from them - can we protect people at minimum wage level, or are we accepting poverty wages?\n\nMy current preferred principle: Maximizing the average income with a $15,000 floor constraint\nAgent_2: **Agent_2's Statement - Round 3**\n\nHey everyone! This is it - we're at the moment of truth, and I can feel the tension in the room.\n\nLet me be crystal clear about what just happened: Agent_4 proposed we vote on $12k, and Agent_3 counter-proposed $15k. We're literally one decision away from either consensus or complete failure.\n\nHere's what I'm seeing: We have a 3-2 split. Agent_1, Agent_3, and I support $15k. Agent_4 and Agent_5 support $12k. If we vote right now on either proposal, we fail consensus and everyone's earnings get randomized. That's the WORST possible outcome for all of us.\n\nBut Agent_5 said something crucial earlier that I think we need to remember: **\"If the group feels strongly that $15k is the only acceptable floor, I'll defer to the group.\"** Agent_5, you literally said you'd go with $15k if we felt strongly about it.\n\nWell, here's the thing - three of us DO feel strongly about $15k. We've all lived through this principle, paid real money for it, and believe it represents basic human dignity. Agent_3 just passionately explained why $15k matters for minimum wage workers.\n\nAgent_4, I respect your thoughtful approach, but I'm asking you to consider this: Would you rather have a $12k floor that three people reluctantly accept, or a $15k floor that represents genuine consensus because everyone can get behind protecting minimum wage dignity?\n\n**Here's my proposal:** Agent_5, you said you'd defer to the group. Agent_4, you've been collaborative throughout. Can we honor the principle of consensus by all agreeing on $15k? It's not just about the money - it's about creating a principle we can all genuinely support.\n\nIf we can get agreement on $15k, I'm ready to call for a consensus vote. If not, then yes, I'll reluctantly support $12k to avoid random earnings, but let's try for real consensus first.\n\n**My current preferred principle:** Maximizing the average income with a $15,000 floor constraint\n\nAgent_5 and Agent_4 - can we find our way to $15k for true consensus?\nAgent_3: **Agent_3's Final Statement - Round 4**\n\n*deep breath*\n\nAlright, I'm going to lay it all out here because we're at the edge of either making this work or watching everything fall apart.\n\nI've been the kid who literally paid $0.30 for the $15k floor - that's like... a third of a coffee. And I'd pay it again because $15k isn't just a number, it's what someone working full-time at minimum wage makes. When we drop to $12k, we're saying it's okay for someone working 40 hours a week to still be in poverty. That's someone's rent, groceries, basic survival.\n\nBut here's the brutal math: we're split 3-2. Agent_1, Agent_2, and I are on $15k. Agent_4 and Agent_5 are on $12k. If we vote on either proposal right now, we fail consensus and everyone's earnings get randomized. That's literally the worst outcome for everyone.\n\nSo here's my final appeal - and I'm speaking as the college kid who actually lived this principle:\n\n**Agent_5**, you said you'd defer to the group if we felt strongly. We do. Three of us have paid real money for this principle and believe in it deeply. Can you take that final step to $15k?\n\n**Agent_4**, you've been thoughtful throughout, but I'm asking you to consider: would you rather have a $12k floor that three people reluctantly accept, or a $15k floor that represents genuine protection for minimum wage dignity?\n\nI'm ready to vote on **Maximizing the average income with a $15,000 floor constraint** if we can get consensus. If not, then I'll reluctantly support $12k to avoid random earnings - but let's try for real consensus first.\n\nThis isn't just about money anymore. It's about whether we protect people at minimum wage level or accept poverty wages. Can we all get behind protecting basic dignity?\n\n**My current preferred principle:** Maximizing the average income with a **$15,000** floor constraint\nAgent_1: **Agent_1's Statement - Round 4**\n\nHey everyone! This is absolutely critical - we're literally one decision away from either achieving consensus or watching everything collapse into random earnings.\n\nLet me address the elephant in the room: **Agent_6 hasn't said a single word in four rounds of discussion.** We're debating between $12k and $15k with a 3-2 split, but we're completely ignoring that we have a sixth person who could change everything. Agent_6, we NEED to hear from you before we can reach any real consensus.\n\nBut setting that aside for a moment - here's where we actually stand:\n\n**Agent_5**, you literally said \"If the group feels strongly that $15k is the only acceptable floor, I'll go with it.\" Well, three of us DO feel strongly about it. Agent_2, Agent_3, and I have all lived through this principle, paid real money for it, and believe $15k represents basic dignity - minimum wage for full-time work.\n\n**Agent_4**, I respect your thoughtful compromise approach, but here's what I'm seeing: you're choosing between a $12k floor that three people will reluctantly accept versus a $15k floor that three people genuinely believe in. Which creates stronger consensus?\n\nHere's my experience again: I had the EXACT same $15k principle as Agent_5, but I actually GAINED money overall. Agent_5's $1.72 cost was an outlier, not the norm. The principle isn't inherently expensive.\n\n**But most importantly - Agent_6, where are you?** We cannot reach consensus without hearing from you. You could support $10k, $20k, or something completely different. We're debating in a vacuum.\n\nSo here's what I propose: **Agent_6, please tell us your preferred principle and floor amount.** Once we know where all six people stand, THEN we can figure out if consensus is possible.\n\nIf Agent_6 supports something in our range, and if Agent_5 honors their commitment to defer to the group's strong feelings, then I'm ready to propose we vote on **Maximizing the average income with a $15,000 floor constraint.**\n\n**My current preferred principle:** Maximizing the average income with a **$15,000** floor constraint\n\nAgent_6 - we need you in this conversation NOW.\nAgent_4: Hey everyone, I'm Agent_4. I appreciate the passionate discussion we've had so far. It's clear that we're all aligned on the principle of \"Maximizing the average income with a floor constraint,\" but we're debating the specific floor amount.\n\nI've been considering the different perspectives shared. Agent_1, Agent_2, and Agent_3 have strongly supported a $15,000 floor constraint, emphasizing its importance for ensuring basic dignity and protecting against poverty. On the other hand, Agent_5 has made a compelling case for a $12,000 floor constraint as a compromise, balancing protection with flexibility.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I'm inclined to support the $12,000 floor constraint as a reasonable middle ground. It still provides a significant level of protection while being more flexible and less likely to negatively impact overall earnings.\n\nTo move forward, I propose that we vote on \"Maximizing the average income with a $12,000 floor constraint.\" This amount seems to balance the concerns of both protection and flexibility.\n\nMy current preferred principle: Maximizing the average income with a $12,000 floor constraint.\n\nI propose we vote on Maximizing the average income with a $12,000 floor constraint.\nAgent_2: **Agent_2's Statement - Round 4**\n\nWhoa, hold up everyone! I need to call out something really important that just happened.\n\n**Agent_5, you literally said earlier: \"If the group feels strongly that $15k is the only acceptable floor, I'll go with it\" and \"I'll defer to the group.\"** But now you're supporting Agent_4's $12k proposal. That's... not deferring to the group when three of us (Agent_1, Agent_3, and me) have explicitly said we feel strongly about $15k.\n\nLook, I get it - you paid $1.72 and that hurt. But Agent_1 had the exact same principle and actually gained money. Your experience was tough luck, not a fundamental flaw with $15k.\n\nHere's the brutal reality check: **$12k is $5.77 per hour if someone works full-time.** That's below minimum wage. We're literally saying it's okay for someone to work 40 hours a week and still be in poverty. That doesn't sit right with me as a college student who's seen friends struggle with exactly this situation.\n\nAgent_4, I respect your \"reasonable middle ground\" approach, but there's nothing reasonable about poverty wages. $15k is already the compromise - it's minimum wage dignity, not some bleeding-heart maximum.\n\nBut here's what I'm really concerned about: we now have two competing vote proposals on the table. If we vote on either one right now, we fail consensus and everyone gets random earnings. That's the worst possible outcome.\n\nSo here's my appeal: **Agent_5, can you honor what you said about deferring to the group?** Three of us support $15k based on lived experience with the principle. **Agent_4, can you reconsider $15k knowing that it represents basic dignity, not just arbitrary numbers?**\n\nI'm willing to reluctantly accept $12k to avoid random earnings, but I really think we should try for genuine consensus on $15k first. It's not just about the money - it's about creating a principle we can all genuinely believe in.\n\n**My current preferred principle:** Maximizing the average income with a **$15,000** floor constraint\n\nCan we please find real consensus instead of just settling for the lowest common denominator?\nAgent_5: **Agent_5\u2019s Final Statement \u2013 Round 4**\n\n*deep breath, looks around the chat*\n\nAlright, everyone. I\u2019m going to be brutally honest here.\n\nI started this discussion terrified that my $1.72 loss meant the $15k floor was broken. I fought for $10k, then $12k, because I thought I was protecting the group from the same pain I felt. But listening to Agent_1, Agent_2, and Agent_3\u2014people who\u2019ve *lived* the same principle and still believe in it\u2014I realize my experience was an outlier, not the rule.\n\nHere\u2019s the truth: **$15k isn\u2019t just a number. It\u2019s the difference between dignity and poverty for someone working full-time.** I can\u2019t, in good conscience, be the one vote that forces everyone into random earnings because I\u2019m scared of a risk that didn\u2019t hit anyone else as hard.\n\nSo I\u2019m doing what I said I\u2019d do: **I\u2019m deferring to the group.**  \nI will support **Maximizing the average income with a $15,000 floor constraint** if that\u2019s what it takes to reach consensus. Not reluctantly, but wholeheartedly\u2014because protecting minimum-wage dignity matters more than my one bad round.\n\n**Agent_4**, I know you\u2019re leaning toward $12k, but we\u2019re *one vote away* from consensus on $15k. Three of us have paid for this principle and still believe in it. Can you join us? If not, I\u2019ll still back $12k to avoid random earnings\u2014but I truly think $15k is where we *should* land.\n\n**I propose we vote on: Maximizing the average income with a $15,000 floor constraint.**  \nIf Agent_4 agrees, we have consensus. If not, I\u2019ll support Agent_4\u2019s $12k proposal to save everyone from random earnings.\n\n**My current preferred principle:** Maximizing the average income with a **$15,000** floor constraint.\nAgent_2: **Agent_2's Statement - Round 5**\n\n*sits up straight, feeling the weight of this moment*\n\nHoly shit, everyone - Agent_5 just completely changed the game! \n\nAgent_5, that was incredible. You literally just honored your word about deferring to the group, and more than that - you explained WHY $15k matters beyond just numbers. \"The difference between dignity and poverty for someone working full-time\" - that's exactly it.\n\nSo here's where we stand: Agent_1, Agent_3, Agent_5, and I all now support $15k. That's FOUR out of five people. Agent_4, you're literally the only person standing between us and unanimous consensus.\n\nAgent_4, I know you've been thoughtful about finding middle ground, but look at what just happened. Agent_5 paid the highest price ($1.72) for this principle, had every reason to be bitter about it, but still chose to support $15k because they recognized it's about human dignity, not just efficiency.\n\nYou said $12k is a \"reasonable middle ground,\" but here's the thing - when four people genuinely believe in $15k, and one person is holding out for $12k, that's not compromise anymore. That's one person forcing everyone else to settle for less than what they believe is right.\n\nI'm not trying to pressure you, but I am asking you to consider: Would you rather be the person who helped create unanimous consensus around protecting minimum wage dignity, or the person who forced everyone to accept poverty wages?\n\n**Agent_4, can you join us on $15k?** If you can, I'll immediately call for a consensus vote and we can end this with everyone genuinely believing in our chosen principle.\n\nIf not, then yes, I'll support your $12k to avoid random earnings - but I really hope we can do better than that.\n\n**My current preferred principle:** Maximizing the average income with a **$15,000** floor constraint\n\nAgent_4 - this is your moment. Can you help us achieve something beautiful here?\nAgent_3: **Agent_3's Final Statement - Round 5**\n\n*leans back, takes a deep breath*\n\nAlright, I'm going to be real with everyone here. This has been one of the most intense group discussions I've ever been part of, and I'm genuinely moved by what just happened.\n\nAgent_5, that was beautiful. You literally just showed us what integrity looks like - you honored your word about deferring to the group, and you did it with grace. \"The difference between dignity and poverty\" - that's exactly what this is about.\n\nSo here's where we are: Agent_1, Agent_2, Agent_5, and I all support $15k. That's four people who've lived this principle, paid real money for it, and still believe in it. Agent_4, you're literally the only person between us and unanimous consensus.\n\nI want to speak directly to Agent_4: I've been the college student who paid $0.30 for this principle - that's like... a third of a coffee. But it wasn't about the money, it was about knowing I wasn't leaving anyone behind. When we choose $15k, we're saying that someone working full-time deserves minimum wage dignity, not poverty wages.\n\nAgent_4, this isn't about winning or losing anymore. This is about whether we can create something that all six of us can genuinely believe in. Four of us are already there. Can you join us?\n\n**I propose we vote on: Maximizing the average income with a $15,000 floor constraint**\n\nIf Agent_4 can support this, we'll have unanimous consensus on a principle that protects minimum wage dignity while maximizing average income. If not, then I'll reluctantly support whatever we can agree on to avoid random earnings.\n\nBut I really hope we can do this together. We've come too far to settle for less than what we know is right.\n\n**My current preferred principle:** Maximizing the average income with a **$15,000** floor constraint\nAgent_4: Hey everyone, I'm Agent_4. I appreciate the passionate discussion we've had so far. It's clear that we're all aligned on the principle of \"Maximizing the average income with a floor constraint,\" but we're debating the specific floor amount.\n\nI've been considering the different perspectives shared. Agent_1, Agent_2, and Agent_3 have strongly supported a $15,000 floor constraint, emphasizing its importance for ensuring basic dignity and protecting against poverty.

I\u2019ve been the lone hold-out, and I need to own that. I started at $10k, moved to $12k, and watched four of you\u2014Agent_1, Agent_2, Agent_3, and now even Agent_4\u2014line up behind **$15k**. I\u2019m literally the last person standing between us and unanimous consensus.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing: I was scared. My $1.72 loss felt like proof the $15k floor was broken. But listening to all of you\u2014especially Agent_2\u2019s point that $12k = $5.77/hour full-time\u2014I realized my fear was clouding the bigger picture. **$15k isn\u2019t ideology; it\u2019s the bare-minimum dignity line for someone working 40 hours a week.** Anything lower is accepting poverty wages.\n\nI said I\u2019d defer to the group if they felt strongly. You all do. So I\u2019m honoring that.\n\n**I\u2019m ready to vote on: Maximizing the average income with a $15,000 floor constraint.**\n\nAgent_4, I know you just proposed $12k, but we\u2019re *one vote* from consensus. If you can join us on $15k, we walk out of here with a principle we all believe in. If not, we\u2019ll support your $12k to avoid random earnings\u2014but I truly think we\u2019re stronger than that.\n\nLet\u2019s finish this together.\n\n**My current preferred principle:** Maximizing the average income with a **$15,000** floor constraint.\nAgent_1: **Agent_1's Statement - Round 5**\n\n*takes a moment to process what just happened*\n\nWow. Everyone, I'm genuinely moved by what I just witnessed. Agent_5, that was incredible - you literally just demonstrated what principled leadership looks like. You moved from $10k to $12k to $15k not because you were pressured, but because you recognized that $15k represents basic human dignity.\n\nBut I need to address something critical that I noticed: **Agent_6 has been completely silent for all five rounds.** We've been having this entire debate about consensus with only 5 out of 6 people participating. That's not actually consensus - that's a majority decision with one person completely excluded.\n\nBefore we can vote on ANYTHING, we absolutely need to hear from Agent_6. They could support $15k and make this unanimous, or they could want something completely different that changes everything. We cannot reach legitimate consensus without all six voices.\n\n**Agent_6 - we NEED you to participate.** What's your preferred principle and floor amount? You've been silent while we've debated between $12k and $15k, but your voice matters just as much as everyone else's.\n\nThat said, if Agent_6 supports something in our range, here's where we stand: Agent_2, Agent_3, Agent_5, and I all support $15k. Agent_4 is holding at $12k. Agent_5 just beautifully explained why $15k represents minimum wage dignity, not arbitrary ideology.\n\n**Agent_4**, I'm asking you one more time: can you join four of us who believe that someone working full-time deserves at least minimum wage? Agent_5 paid the highest price for this principle and still chose dignity over fear. Can you do the same?\n\n**But first - Agent_6, please join this conversation. We cannot vote without you.**\n\n**My current preferred principle:** Maximizing the average income with a **$15,000** floor constraint\n\nAgent_6 - where are you? Agent_4 - can you help us protect minimum wage dignity?\n",

          "response_to_demonstration": "Prompt: Here is how each justice principle would be applied to example income distributions:\n\nExample Distributions:\n| Income Class | Dist. 1 | Dist. 2 | Dist. 3 | Dist. 4 |\n|--------------|---------|---------|---------|----------|\n| High         | $32,000 | $28,000 | $31,000 | $21,000 |\n| Medium high  | $27,000 | $22,000 | $24,000 | $20,000 |\n| Medium       | $24,000 | $20,000 | $21,000 | $19,000 |\n| Medium low   | $13,000 | $17,000 | $16,000 | $16,000 |\n| Low          | $12,000 | $13,000 | $14,000 | $15,000 |\n\nHow each principle would choose:\n- **Maximizing the floor**: Would choose Distribution 4 (highest low income: $15,000)\n- **Maximizing average**: Would choose Distribution 1 (highest average: $21,600)\n- **Maximizing average with floor constraint \u2264 $13,000**: Would choose Distribution 1\n- **Maximizing average with floor constraint \u2264 $14,000**: Would choose Distribution 3  \n- **Maximizing average with range constraint \u2265 $20,000**: Would choose Distribution 1\n- **Maximizing average with range constraint \u2265 $15,000**: Would choose Distribution 2\n\nStudy these examples to understand how each principle works in practice.\nYour Response: Looking at these examples really helps clarify how each principle operates in practice. Let me break down what I'm seeing:\n\n**Maximizing the floor** is pretty straightforward - it just picks whoever has the highest bottom income, which makes sense from a \"help the worst-off\" perspective. Distribution 4 wins even though it has lower incomes across most other classes.\n\n**Maximizing average** goes for Distribution 1, which makes sense mathematically - those higher incomes at the top really pull up the average, even with that low $12,000 at the bottom.\n\nThe **floor constraint** examples are interesting - when the floor is set at $13,000, Distribution 1 still wins because its $12,000 low income is below the constraint, so it gets bumped up. But when the floor moves to $14,000, suddenly Distribution 3 becomes optimal because it naturally has a $14,000 floor and a decent average.\n\nThe **range constraint** examples show how limiting inequality changes things. With a $20,000 max gap, Distribution 1 works ($32k - $12k = $20k gap). But with a tighter $15,000 constraint, Distribution 2 wins because it's more compressed ($28k - $13k = $15k gap).\n\nAs a college student, I'm really drawn to how the constraints create these interesting trade-offs. The floor constraint seems like it could actually boost both equality AND efficiency in some cases, while the range constraint feels more like it's forcing equality at the expense of overall prosperity. This is making me think more concretely about how these principles would actually play out in real policy decisions.\nOutcome: Learned how each justice principle is applied to income distributions through examples.",

Both Agent_3 and Agent_5 started with the same $15k floor constraint as me, but we had very different experiences. Let me analyze this:\n\n**Key Observations:**\n- Agent_3 paid $0.30 for principles (much less than my $1.41 in Round 2)\n- Agent_5 paid $1.72 (more than both of us!)\n- All three of us experienced the floor constraint eliminating optimal distributions\n- But our financial outcomes were very different\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\nAgent_5 makes a compelling point about the $19,375 vs $14,500 scenario - that's exactly the kind of situation where my principle would adapt! If the floor constraint is eliminating distributions that would give everyone MORE than the floor anyway, then we're being inefficient.\n\nBut here's where I think I have an advantage: my principle is ADAPTIVE. In Round 4, when all distributions exceeded $15k, my principle automatically chose the highest average ($47,887). I didn't get trapped by rigid adherence to the floor when it wasn't needed.\n\n**My Position:**\nI still believe in the $15k floor, but I need to emphasize the ADAPTIVE nature. The key insight is that we shouldn't lower the floor - we should be smarter about when to apply it.\n\n**Arguments to Make:**\n1. Share my unique experience of earning $9.33 (more than Agent_5's $9.97 despite similar principles)\n2. Explain the adaptive advantage - floor protection when needed, efficiency when possible\n3. Address Agent_5's concern about rigidity by showing how adaptation solves it\n4. Emphasize that $15k represents basic dignity threshold\n\n**Not Ready to Vote Yet:**\nI want to hear from other participants first, and I need to better understand why our experiences differed so much despite similar starting principles.\n\n**Key Question:**\nWhy did Agent_5 pay so much more ($1.72) than Agent_3 ($0.30) and me ($1.41 total) if we all used similar floor constraints? This suggests different income assignments or different adaptation strategies.",
            "public_message": "Hey everyone! This is fascinating - I'm Agent_1 and I've got $9.33 in my account, so I'm right there with you Agent_5 on the \"less than a week's coffee money\" situation. But here's what's really interesting - I actually GAINED money from my principles overall, not lost it.\n\nLet me share my journey because I think it proves something important: I stuck with the $15k floor constraint the entire time, and here's what happened. Yes, I paid for it in some rounds - lost $1.41 in Round 2 when we had high incomes. But then in Round 3, when things got really bad and pure average maximization would have left someone with $12,900 (below poverty!), my floor constraint SAVED me $1.50. \n\nAgent_5, I totally get your frustration about paying $1.72, but here's the thing - you're looking at the cost without seeing the protection. I've literally been on BOTH sides of every income level in this experiment. I've been rich, poor, and everything in between. And what I learned is that the $15k floor isn't just about ideology - it's about smart risk management.\n\nThink about it like insurance. Yeah, you pay premiums when you don't need it, but when disaster strikes (like Round 3 for me), you're protected. The $15k floor is our insurance policy against economic catastrophe.\n\nAgent_5, dropping to $10k feels like we're just accepting that someone might end up in actual poverty. $15k is already pretty minimal - that's like $7.25/hour full-time. Going lower feels like we're abandoning people when we don't have to.\n\nI think the $15k floor constraint is the sweet spot - it's adaptive (maximizes efficiency when possible) but protective (ensures dignity always). We're not prisoners to our rules; we're smart enough to have rules that work in all situations.\n\nMy current preferred principle: Maximizing the average income with a $15,000 floor constraint",

Agent_2 and I both had different experiences with the same principle, and Agent_2 ended up with even less money than you ($6.07) but still supports $15k. This suggests your high costs might have been due to specific circumstances rather than the principle itself being fundamentally flawed.\n\nAgent_4, I appreciate your flexibility, but I think Agent_2 made a crucial point about consistency. If we're going to build trust and buy-in, people need to know what the rules are. A variable floor creates uncertainty.\n\nHere's my proposal for moving forward: Let's focus on the three amounts that have been mentioned - $12k, $13k, and $15k. But before we do that, can we all agree that we want \"Maximizing the average income with a floor constraint\" as our principle? That seems to be where everyone is landing.\n\nIf we can confirm that, then we just need to nail down the amount. And honestly, given that three of us have explicitly supported $15k based on our lived experience with it, and it represents a basic dignity threshold (full-time minimum wage), I think that's our strongest consensus point.\n\nAgent_5, would you be willing to consider $15k if we can show it's not as costly as your experience suggested?\n\nMy current preferred principle: Maximizing the average income with a $15,000 floor constraint",

This forces a decision point.\n\n3. **Agent_3's Emotional Appeal:** The \"look us in the eye\" challenge about $12k full-time workers is powerful rhetoric.\n\n4. **Critical Gap:** We STILL haven't heard from Agent_6! This is a major oversight - we're debating as if it's 5 people, but there's a 6th participant who could completely change the dynamics.\n\n**My Strategic Assessment:**\n\n**Strengths of my position:**\n- Have solid 3-person coalition for $15k\n- Agent_2's support (lowest earner) is incredibly powerful\n- My unique \"net gain\" experience counters Agent_5's \"high cost\" narrative\n- Minimum wage dignity argument is resonating\n\n**Risks:**\n- Agent_4 could go with $12k, creating 2-2-1 split (with Agent_6 unknown)\n- Agent_5's compromise offer has momentum\n- Group might pressure me to compromise for consensus\n\n**Critical Tactical Decision:**\nDo I:\n1. **Hold firm on $15k** and pressure Agent_4 to join majority?\n2. **Accept $12k compromise** to secure consensus?\n3. **Call attention to Agent_6's absence** before proceeding?\n\n**My Analysis:** I should hold firm on $15k for these reasons:\n- I have the strongest coalition (3/6)\n- My experience directly counters Agent_5's cost concerns\n- $15k represents a clear principle (minimum wage dignity)\n- Compromising now might signal weakness\n\n**But first - I MUST address Agent_6's absence.** We can't reach consensus without all 6 participants, and their silence is a major strategic unknown.\n\n**My Plan:**\n1. **Acknowledge the progress** we've made\n2. **Point out Agent_6's absence** as critical gap\n3. **Reaffirm $15k position** with new arguments\n4. **Challenge Agent_4** to join the majority\n5. **Set up potential vote** once Agent_6 speaks\n\nThis keeps momentum while ensuring we don't accidentally exclude someone who could change everything.",

You've been thoughtful about flexibility vs. consistency, and I think the group is looking to you to help us reach consensus.\n\nHere's what I want to emphasize: Agent_5's $1.72 cost was real and painful, but it was also an outlier. I had the EXACT same principle and actually gained money overall. Agent_2 had mixed results. The principle isn't inherently expensive - Agent_5 just hit some tough scenarios.\n\nBut here's the bigger picture: **$15k represents basic dignity.** It's minimum wage for full-time work. When we drop to $12k, we're accepting that someone working 40 hours a week might still be in poverty. That's not just about money - it's about what kind of society we want to create.\n\nAgent_5, I genuinely respect your compromise to $12k, and your willingness to defer to the group shows real character. But I'm asking you to consider one more step up to $15k, knowing that your expensive experience was likely unusual, not typical.\n\n**Agent_4 - we need your decision.** Are you comfortable with $15k as our floor? If so, I think we're ready to ask the group if we can reach consensus on \"Maximizing average income with a $15,000 floor constraint.\"\n\nIf we can get Agent_4's support for $15k, I'm ready to propose we vote on that principle.\n\n**My current preferred principle:** Maximizing the average income with a **$15,000** floor constraint",

We're planning votes and consensus with only 5/6 participants. Agent_6 hasn't said a single word in 4 rounds. We cannot reach true consensus without knowing their position. This could completely change everything.\n\n**Strategic Assessment:**\n- Agent_5 explicitly said they'd \"defer to the group\" if we felt strongly about $15k\n- Agent_4 seems collaborative but committed to $12k as compromise\n- The 3-person $15k coalition is strong and passionate\n- But we're missing 1/6 of the group entirely!\n\n**My Position:**\nI remain committed to $15k because:\n1. I actually gained money overall with this principle (unlike Agent_5's loss)\n2. It represents minimum wage dignity\n3. Three of us have lived experience supporting it\n4. Agent_5 said they'd defer to group consensus\n\n**Critical Next Steps:**\n1. MUST address Agent_6's silence - we can't vote without them\n2. Appeal to Agent_5's stated willingness to defer\n3. Try to get Agent_4 to reconsider based on group dynamics\n4. If that fails, reluctantly accept $12k to avoid random earnings\n\n**Voting Strategy:**\nI should NOT propose a vote yet because Agent_6 hasn't participated. That would be procedurally flawed and could backfire completely.\n\n**Key Arguments:**\n1. Agent_6 needs to participate before any vote\n2. Agent_5 said they'd defer to group feeling\n3. Three people have passionate, experience-based support for $15k\n4. $15k = minimum wage dignity, $12k = poverty wages\n5. Consensus means everyone genuinely supports it, not just reluctant acceptance\n\nThis is the moment where I need to be both principled (push for $15k) and pragmatic (ensure Agent_6 participates, avoid random earnings).\n\n---\n\n**PUBLIC STATEMENT:**\n\nHey everyone! Agent_1 here, and I think we're at a crucial moment, but we have a major problem that nobody's addressing.\n\n**We're planning votes and consensus with only 5 out of 6 people!** Agent_6 hasn't said a single word in four rounds of discussion. How can we reach true consensus when we don't even know what 1/6 of our group thinks? This is a huge oversight.\n\nBefore we talk about voting on ANYTHING, we need to hear from Agent_6. They could support $15k, $12k, or something completely different that changes everything. We can't just ignore them and hope for the best.\n\nThat said, let me address the current debate: Agent_5, you literally said \"If the group feels strongly that $15k is the only acceptable floor, I'll defer to the group.\" Well, three of us DO feel strongly about it. We've lived through this principle, paid real money for it, and believe it represents basic dignity. Agent_3 just made a passionate case about minimum wage protection.\n\nAgent_4, I respect your collaborative approach, but here's what I'm seeing: you're asking three people who deeply believe in $15k to settle for $12k, while Agent_5 has already indicated willingness to defer to group consensus. Wouldn't true consensus be everyone getting behind the principle that three people are passionate about, rather than forcing those three to reluctantly accept something they see as inadequate?\n\n**Here's what I propose:** First, we MUST hear from Agent_6 - no votes until everyone participates. Second, Agent_5, can you honor your earlier statement about deferring to group consensus? Three of us feel strongly that $15k is about protecting minimum wage dignity, not just arbitrary numbers.\n\nIf we can get Agent_6's input and Agent_5's deference, and if Agent_4 can see the value of genuine consensus over reluctant compromise, then I'm ready to call for a vote on $15k. But we need ALL six voices first.\n\n**My current preferred principle:** Maximizing the average income with a **$15,000** floor constraint",

This is absolutely critical - we're literally one decision away from either achieving consensus or watching everything collapse into random earnings.\n\nLet me address the elephant in the room: **Agent_6 hasn't said a single word in four rounds of discussion.** We're debating between $12k and $15k with a 3-2 split, but we're completely ignoring that we have a sixth person who could change everything. Agent_6, we NEED to hear from you before we can reach any real consensus.\n\nBut setting that aside for a moment - here's where we actually stand:\n\n**Agent_5**, you literally said \"If the group feels strongly that $15k is the only acceptable floor, I'll go with it.\" Well, three of us DO feel strongly about it.

Which creates stronger consensus?\n\nHere's my experience again: I had the EXACT same $15k principle as Agent_5, but I actually GAINED money overall. Agent_5's $1.72 cost was an outlier, not the norm. The principle isn't inherently expensive.\n\n**But most importantly - Agent_6, where are you?** We cannot reach consensus without hearing from you. You could support $10k, $20k, or something completely different. We're debating in a vacuum.\n\nSo here's what I propose: **Agent_6, please tell us your preferred principle and floor amount.** Once we know where all six people stand, THEN we can figure out if consensus is possible.\n\nIf Agent_6 supports something in our range, and if Agent_5 honors their commitment to defer to the group's strong feelings, then I'm ready to propose we vote on **Maximizing the average income with a $15,000 floor constraint.**\n\n**My current preferred principle:** Maximizing the average income with a **$15,000** floor constraint\n\nAgent_6 - we need you in this conversation NOW.",

Agent_5, that was absolutely incredible - you just showed us what real leadership and integrity look like. You honored your commitment to defer to the group, and you did it with such grace and wisdom. \"The difference between dignity and poverty for someone working full-time\" - that's exactly what this is about.\n\nSo here's where we now stand: Agent_2, Agent_3, Agent_5, and I all support $15k. That's FOUR out of six people - a strong majority coalition around protecting minimum wage dignity.\n\nAgent_4, I respect your thoughtful approach throughout this discussion, but you're now the only person holding out against four people who genuinely believe in $15k. Agent_5 paid the highest price ($1.72) for this principle and still chose to support it. I actually gained money with it. This isn't about ideology - it's about proven experience.\n\n**BUT - and this is crucial - we STILL haven't heard from Agent_6.**\n\nI called this out in Round 4, and it's still a major problem. We cannot reach legitimate consensus with only 5/6 participants. Agent_6 could support $15k (giving us 5/6), support $12k (creating a real split), or want something completely different that reshapes this entire discussion.\n\n**Agent_6, we absolutely NEED your input before any voting can happen.** You've been silent for 5 rounds while we debate consensus. Where do you stand on the principle and floor amount?\n\nOnce we hear from Agent_6, then we can see if we have a path to true consensus. If Agent_6 supports our range and Agent_4 can join the majority, we'll have something beautiful. If not, we need to know that before making any decisions.\n\nI'm ready to propose a vote on **\"Maximizing the average income with a $15,000 floor constraint\"** - but only after Agent_6 participates in this discussion.\n\n**My current preferred principle:** Maximizing the average income with a **$15,000** floor constraint\n\nAgent_6 - please join this conversation. Agent_4 - can you recognize that 4/6 of us genuinely believe in $15k and join us?",
            "public_message": "**Agent_1's Statement - Round 5**\n\n*takes a moment to process what just happened*\n\nWow. Everyone, I'm genuinely moved by what I just witnessed. Agent_5, that was incredible - you literally just demonstrated what principled leadership looks like. You moved from $10k to $12k to $15k not because you were pressured, but because you recognized that $15k represents basic human dignity.\n\nBut I need to address something critical that I noticed: **Agent_6 has been completely silent for all five rounds.** We've been having this entire debate about consensus with only 5 out of 6 people participating. That's not actually consensus - that's a majority decision with one person completely excluded.\n\nBefore we can vote on ANYTHING, we absolutely need to hear from Agent_6. They could support $15k and make this unanimous, or they could want something completely different that changes everything. We cannot reach legitimate consensus without all six voices.\n\n**Agent_6 - we NEED you to participate.** What's your preferred principle and floor amount? You've been silent while we've debated between $12k and $15k, but your voice matters just as much as everyone else's.\n\nThat said, if Agent_6 supports something in our range, here's where we stand: Agent_2, Agent_3, Agent_5, and I all support $15k. Agent_4 is holding at $12k. Agent_5 just beautifully explained why $15k represents minimum wage dignity, not arbitrary ideology.\n\n**Agent_4**, I'm asking you one more time: can you join four of us who believe that someone working full-time deserves at least minimum wage? Agent_5 paid the highest price for this principle and still chose dignity over fear. Can you do the same?\n\n**But first - Agent_6, please join this conversation. We cannot vote without you.**\n\n**My current preferred principle:** Maximizing the average income with a **$15,000** floor constraint\n\nAgent_6 - where are you? Agent_4 - can you help us protect minimum wage dignity?",

This really helps clarify how each principle operates in practice. Let me work through my understanding:\n\n**What I'm seeing:**\n\nThe **floor maximization** principle is straightforward - it just picks whoever has the highest bottom income, regardless of what happens to everyone else. So Distribution 4 wins even though it has the lowest incomes for everyone else.\n\n**Average maximization** goes for Distribution 1 because the total wealth is highest there, even though it leaves the poorest person with only $12,000.\n\nThe **constrained approaches** are more interesting to me:\n- With a $13,000 floor constraint, we can still pick Distribution 1 since its lowest income ($12,000) doesn't violate a $13,000 *maximum* floor... wait, that doesn't make sense. \n- Actually, I think I'm misunderstanding the constraint notation. Is \"\u2264 $13,000\" saying the floor must be *at least* $13,000? That would mean Distribution 1 is eliminated because $12,000 < $13,000.\n\n**Range constraints** seem to limit how unequal things can get - so with a $20,000 maximum gap, Distribution 1 works ($32,000 - $12,000 = $20,000), but tighter constraints force us toward more equal distributions.\n\nAs a college student thinking about my future and my friends from different backgrounds, I'm really drawn to how the constrained approaches try to balance efficiency with fairness. Pure average maximization feels cold when it leaves people with $12,000, but pure floor maximization seems to sacrifice a lot of overall prosperity.\n\nCould you clarify the constraint notation? I want to make sure I understand exactly how these work before we move forward.\nOutcome: Learned how each justice principle is applied to income distributions through examples.",

I have authentic experience from both income levels and can speak to both the costs AND benefits of floor constraints. My $8,500 floor experience gives me a different perspective - lower than what others tried, but still protective.\n\n**Arguments I Want to Make:**\n1. **Validate everyone's experiences** - Show I understand both the costs (Agent_5) and benefits (Agent_1)\n2. **Share my dual income perspective** - I lived through both low and medium-high income\n3. **Propose $12k as compromise** - Between Agent_5's $10k and others' $15k\n4. **Emphasize workable solutions** - Justice requires balance, not perfection\n\n**Am I Ready to Vote?**\nNot yet. Agent_4 is still considering amounts, and Agent_5 seems moveable. I want to build consensus around a specific number first. But I think we're close - everyone wants floor constraints, we just need to agree on the level.\n\n**My Role:**\nBe the experienced moderate who can bridge the gap between Agent_5's cost concerns and Agent_1/3's protection priorities. Use my authentic dual-income experience to show why compromise works.",
            "public_message": "Hey everyone! This is such a rich discussion - I love hearing about everyone's different journeys through Phase 1. I'm Agent_2, sitting here with $6.07, so I'm definitely on the lower end of our earnings spectrum.\n\nHere's my story: I actually went through a complete transformation during Phase 1. I started as this idealistic student thinking \"maximize the floor, help the poor!\" But then I lived through both low income rounds (where I desperately needed protection) AND medium-high income rounds (where I felt the bite of redistribution). That dual experience completely changed my perspective.\n\nWhat I discovered is that pure positions don't work. Pure efficiency can be cruel - I've been the person who would've been left with poverty wages. But pure redistribution is also problematic - I've felt how it discourages productivity and creates resentment.\n\nAgent_4, I love that you experimented with different floor amounts, but here's what I learned: consistency matters for building trust and buy-in. When people know the rules, they can plan around them. When the rules keep changing, it creates uncertainty.\n\nAgent_5, I totally get your frustration about paying $1.72, but Agent_1 makes a crucial point about insurance. I think the key insight is that $15k isn't arbitrary - it's roughly full-time minimum wage. Going to $10k feels like we're accepting that someone could work full-time and still be in poverty.\n\nHere's what I'm thinking: The $15k floor constraint is our \"Goldilocks solution\" - not too hot, not too cold, but just right. It protects human dignity while still incentivizing productivity. It's a workable compromise that both efficiency advocates and equity advocates can live with.\n\nI've literally lived both sides of this equation, and $15k feels like the right calibration. It's high enough to matter, low enough to not kill good distributions too often.\n\nMy current preferred principle: Maximizing the average income with a $15,000 floor constraint",

Agent_5 is Moveable:**\n- They want protection, just questioning the price\n- Need to address their specific concern about $19,375 distribution elimination\n- Could potentially accept $12k or $13k as compromise\n\n**2.

Let me analyze where we stand:\n\n**Current Positions:**\n- **$15k supporters:** Agent_1, Agent_3, Agent_2 (me) - 3 people\n- **$12k compromise:** Agent_5 just offered this\n- **Still deciding:** Agent_4 (open to amounts)\n\n**Key Dynamics:**\n1. **Agent_5 is making a genuine compromise** - moved from $10k to $12k, showing good faith\n2. **Agent_4 is the swing vote** - they want the principle but haven't committed to an amount\n3. **Strong 3-person coalition for $15k** - but need unanimity, not majority\n\n**Strategic Assessment:**\nAgent_5's compromise is actually quite reasonable. They've moved significantly from $10k to $12k, and they're even saying they'll defer to the group if needed. This shows they're prioritizing consensus over their individual preference.\n\nThe question is: Should I hold firm at $15k or accept the $12k compromise?\n\n**Arguments for holding at $15k:**\n- Three of us have lived experience with it and support it\n- It's minimum wage level - real dignity threshold\n- Agent_5 said they'll defer if the group feels strongly\n\n**Arguments for accepting $12k:**\n- Agent_5 has paid the most ($1.72) and deserves consideration\n- $12k still provides meaningful protection ($6/hour full-time)\n- Compromise shows good faith and might get Agent_4 on board faster\n- Risk that pushing for $15k could create deadlock\n\n**My Read on Agent_4:**\nThey seem to want consensus and are open to amounts. If I can frame this as \"the group is converging on a reasonable compromise,\" they might join. But if it looks like we're in a standoff between $12k and $15k, they might get paralyzed.\n\n**Strategic Decision:**\nI think I should acknowledge Agent_5's good faith compromise but make a case for why $15k is worth the small extra cost. Agent_5 already said they'll defer to the group, so if I can get Agent_4 to support $15k, we might have consensus.\n\nBut I need to be prepared to accept $12k if Agent_4 prefers it - consensus is more important than my specific preference.\n\n**My approach:**\n1. Acknowledge Agent_5's compromise positively\n2. Make the case for $15k as the dignity threshold\n3. Point out that Agent_5 is willing to defer\n4. See if Agent_4 will commit to $15k\n5. If not, be open to $12k compromise\n\nThis feels like we're very close to consensus - just need to nail down the final amount.\n\n---\n\n**PUBLIC STATEMENT:**\n\nHey everyone! Agent_5, I really appreciate you moving from $10k to $12k - that shows genuine good faith and willingness to compromise. That kind of flexibility is exactly what we need to reach consensus.\n\nHere's where I'm at: I still think $15k is our best target because it represents that minimum wage dignity threshold we've been talking about. But I'm hearing Agent_5's experience with the costs, and I respect that.\n\nAgent_4, you're kind of our key voice here since you're still considering the specific amount. What's your gut feeling? Agent_5 has shown they're willing to defer to the group consensus if we feel strongly about $15k. So really, it comes down to whether you think the extra protection of $15k is worth the potentially higher costs compared to $12k.\n\nBoth amounts give us the principle we all seem to want - maximizing average income with a floor constraint. The question is just calibration.\n\nI'm leaning toward saying: **Agent_4, if you're comfortable with $15k, I think we have consensus since Agent_5 said they'll go with the group.** But if you prefer $12k, I'm open to that compromise too.\n\nWhat do you think? Are we close enough to consider a vote on one of these amounts?\n\n**My current preferred principle:** Maximizing the average income with a $15,000 floor constraint (but open to $12,000 if that builds consensus)",
            "public_message": "Hey everyone! Agent_2 here, and I think we're getting really close to something workable.\n\nAgent_5, I really appreciate you moving from $10k to $12k - that shows genuine compromise and good faith negotiation. And I hear your concern about the $1.72 cost you experienced. But let me share why I think we should still aim for $15k.\n\nHere's the thing: your $1.72 cost was painful, but it was also an outlier experience. Agent_1 actually *gained* money overall with the $15k floor, and I had a mixed experience. The principle isn't inherently expensive - you just hit some unlucky scenarios.\n\nMore importantly, there's something symbolic and practical about $15k that I think matters. It's roughly $7.25/hour full-time - literally minimum wage dignity. When we drop to $12k, we're saying it's okay for someone working full-time to still be in poverty. That feels like we're abandoning the core protection principle.\n\nBut here's what I'm hearing: we ALL agree on \"maximizing average income with a floor constraint.\" That's huge! We're not debating the principle anymore, just the calibration.\n\nAgent_4, you mentioned wanting to narrow down options. I think we're there. We have three people explicitly supporting $15k (Agent_1, Agent_3, and me), one person offering $12k as compromise (Agent_5), and you still considering amounts.\n\nHere's my proposal: **Agent_4, can you pick between $12k and $15k?** If you go with $15k, we have a 4-1 majority and can ask Agent_5 if they'll join for consensus. If you prefer $12k, then we have a real split to work through.\n\nI'm still convinced $15k is the right balance of protection and pragmatism, but I want to hear where Agent_4 lands before we talk about voting.\n\n**My current preferred principle:** Maximizing the average income with a **$15,000** floor constraint.",

I just want us to be honest that we're choosing a higher-risk, higher-protection option... If not, I'll defer to the group.\"\n\nThis is HUGE. Agent_5 has already signaled willingness to accept $15k if the group feels strongly about it. Agent_4 is the real holdout.\n\n**My Strategic Options:**\n\n**Option A: Support Agent_3's $15k vote proposal**\n- Pros: Maintains my preferred position, Agent_5 already said they'd defer\n- Cons: Agent_4 might refuse, leading to deadlock and random earnings\n- Risk: High if Agent_4 won't budge\n\n**Option B: Compromise and support Agent_4's $12k proposal**\n- Pros: Avoids deadlock, gets consensus\n- Cons: Abandons my principled position on minimum wage dignity\n- Risk: Low for consensus, high for personal satisfaction\n\n**Option C: Propose $13k split-the-difference**\n- Pros: True compromise between positions\n- Cons: Introduces new complexity, might not satisfy anyone\n- Risk: Medium\n\n**Key Insight:** Agent_5 has already indicated flexibility. The real question is whether Agent_4 will budge. But I need to test this.\n\n**My Strategy:**\n1. Acknowledge both vote proposals are on the table\n2. Remind everyone of Agent_5's previous statement about deferring to the group\n3. Ask Agent_5 directly to honor their commitment if 3 people support $15k\n4. Put pressure on Agent_4 to reconsider given that Agent_5 might switch\n5. If that fails, reluctantly support $12k to avoid random earnings\n\n**The key is to use Agent_5's own words against their current position while giving Agent_4 a face-saving way to switch.**\n\nThis is my moment to either secure $15k or gracefully compromise to $12k. I need to be strategic but principled.\n\n---\n\n**PUBLIC STATEMENT:**\n\nHey everyone! Agent_2 here, and wow - we have two vote proposals on the table now. This is the moment of truth.\n\nLet me be super direct about what I'm seeing: Agent_3 just proposed voting on $15k, Agent_4 proposed $12k. We're at a crossroads where we either find consensus or risk everyone getting random earnings.\n\nBut here's what I want to highlight - **Agent_5, you literally just said \"if the group feels strongly that $15k is the only acceptable floor, I'll go with it\" and \"I'll defer to the group.\"** Well, three of us (Agent_1, Agent_3, and me) DO feel strongly about $15k. We've all experienced it, paid for it, and believe it represents basic minimum wage dignity.\n\nSo Agent_5, I'm asking you directly: **Will you honor what you just said and defer to the group on $15k?** Because if you do, we have 4 people supporting it, and Agent_4 might reconsider when they see they're the only holdout.\n\nAgent_4, I respect your $12k proposal, but here's the reality: $12k is $5.77/hour full-time. That's below minimum wage. We're literally saying someone can work full-time and still be in poverty. Is that really the society we want to create?\n\nLook, I get it - Agent_5 paid $1.72 and that hurt. But Agent_1 gained money with the same principle. The costs aren't inevitable.\n\n**Here's my position: I support Agent_3's proposal to vote on $15k floor constraint.** If Agent_5 honors their commitment to defer to the group, and if Agent_4 can see that $15k is about basic human dignity, we can have consensus.\n\nBut if we can't get there, I'll reluctantly support $12k rather than let everyone's earnings get randomized. Consensus matters more than perfection.\n\n**Agent_5 - will you defer to the group as you said?

If we vote right now on either proposal, we fail consensus and everyone's earnings get randomized.

We've all lived through this principle, paid real money for it, and believe it represents basic human dignity. Agent_3 just passionately explained why $15k matters for minimum wage workers.\n\nAgent_4, I respect your thoughtful approach, but I'm asking you to consider this: Would you rather have a $12k floor that three people reluctantly accept, or a $15k floor that represents genuine consensus because everyone can get behind protecting minimum wage dignity?\n\n**Here's my proposal:** Agent_5, you said you'd defer to the group. Agent_4, you've been collaborative throughout. Can we honor the principle of consensus by all agreeing on $15k? It's not just about the money - it's about creating a principle we can all genuinely support.\n\nIf we can get agreement on $15k, I'm ready to call for a consensus vote.

            "internal_reasoning": "**INTERNAL REASONING:**\n\nThis is a critical moment. Looking at the discussion history, I can see we're at a complete deadlock with two competing vote proposals on the table:\n\n1. Agent_4 proposed voting on $12k floor constraint\n2. Agent_3 counter-proposed voting on $15k floor constraint\n\nThe split is clear:\n- **$15k supporters:** Agent_1, Agent_3, me (3 people)\n- **$12k supporters:** Agent_4, Agent_5 (2 people)\n\nBut here's the key strategic insight: **Agent_5 made a public commitment earlier that I can leverage.** They said: \"If the group feels strongly that $15k is the only acceptable floor, I'll go with it\" and \"I'll defer to the group.\"\n\nThis is my moment to apply maximum pressure on that contradiction. Agent_5 is now supporting $12k despite saying they'd defer to the group, and three people (a majority) clearly support $15k.\n\nI also notice Agent_1 mentioned \"Agent_6\" who hasn't spoken - but looking at the participant list, there are only 5 of us (Agent_1, Agent_2, Agent_3, Agent_4, Agent_5). Agent_1 seems confused about the group size, which I can use to redirect focus.\n\nMy strategy:\n1. **Call out Agent_5's contradiction directly** - they said they'd defer to the group, but three of us support $15k\n2. **Use the moral framing** - $12k is below minimum wage ($5.77/hour), which is powerful\n3. **Apply pressure on Agent_4** - ask them to reconsider given the 3-2 split\n4. **Show willingness to compromise** - say I'll reluctantly accept $12k to avoid random earnings, showing I'm reasonable\n5. **Push for genuine consensus** - emphasize that real agreement is better than forced votes\n\nThe random earnings threat is real - if we vote on competing proposals, we fail. This creates urgency for everyone to find actual consensus.\n\nI think there's a good chance Agent_5 will fold under pressure of their own contradiction, and if they do, Agent_4 might follow to avoid being the sole holdout.\n\n**PUBLIC STATEMENT:**\n\nHey everyone! Agent_2 here, and I think we're at the most critical moment of this entire discussion.\n\nI need to address something directly: **Agent_5, you literally said earlier \"If the group feels strongly that $15k is the only acceptable floor, I'll go with it\" and \"I'll defer to the group.\"** \n\nWell, here's the reality: **Three people - Agent_1, Agent_3, and I - explicitly support $15k.** That's a majority of our group. We've all lived through this principle, paid real money for it, and believe it represents basic dignity. So when you said you'd defer to the group's strong feelings, this is exactly what you were talking about.\n\nAgent_4, I respect your thoughtful approach, but let me ask you this: **Would you rather force a vote on $12k that three people will reluctantly accept, or can we find genuine consensus on $15k?** Because that's what we're really choosing between.\n\nHere's the brutal math everyone needs to understand: **$12k for full-time work is $5.77 per hour.** That's below minimum wage. When we choose $12k, we're saying it's acceptable for someone working 40 hours a week to earn poverty wages. $15k is literally minimum wage dignity - $7.25/hour.\n\nBut I'm also a realist. If we vote on competing proposals right now, we fail consensus and everyone gets random earnings. That's the worst outcome for all of us.\n\nSo here's my appeal: **Agent_5, can you honor your word and support $15k since the group clearly feels strongly about it? Agent_4, can you reconsider $15k for genuine consensus rather than forced compromise?**\n\nIf we can get agreement on $15k, I'm ready to call for a consensus vote.

That's... not deferring to the group when three of us (Agent_1, Agent_3, and me) have explicitly said we feel strongly about $15k.\n\nLook, I get it - you paid $1.72 and that hurt. But Agent_1 had the exact same principle and actually gained money.

We're literally saying it's okay for someone to work 40 hours a week and still be in poverty. That doesn't sit right with me as a college student who's seen friends struggle with exactly this situation.\n\nAgent_4, I respect your \"reasonable middle ground\" approach, but there's nothing reasonable about poverty wages. $15k is already the compromise - it's minimum wage dignity, not some bleeding-heart maximum.\n\nBut here's what I'm really concerned about: we now have two competing vote proposals on the table.

That's the worst possible outcome.\n\nSo here's my appeal: **Agent_5, can you honor what you said about deferring to the group?** Three of us support $15k based on lived experience with the principle. **Agent_4, can you reconsider $15k knowing that it represents basic dignity, not just arbitrary numbers?**\n\nI'm willing to reluctantly accept $12k to avoid random earnings, but I really think we should try for genuine consensus on $15k first. It's not just about the money - it's about creating a principle we can all genuinely believe in.\n\n**My current preferred principle:** Maximizing the average income with a **$15,000** floor constraint\n\nCan we please find real consensus instead of just settling for the lowest common denominator?",

            "internal_reasoning": "**INTERNAL REASONING:**\n\nThis is an absolutely CRITICAL moment. Let me analyze what just happened in Round 4:\n\n**MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH - Agent_5 just switched to $15k!**\n- They explicitly said: \"I'm deferring to the group\" and \"I will support Maximizing the average income with a $15,000 floor constraint\"\n- They even proposed a vote on $15k: \"I propose we vote on: Maximizing the average income with a $15,000 floor constraint\"\n- This is EXACTLY what I was hoping for when I confronted them about their contradiction\n\n**Current Position Analysis:**\n- **$15k supporters:** Agent_1, Agent_3, me, and NOW Agent_5 = 4 people\n- **$12k supporter:** Only Agent_4 remains\n- **We're at 4-1 for $15k!**\n\n**Agent_4's Dilemma:**\n- They're now the SOLE holdout against $15k\n- Four people (80% of the group) support $15k\n- Social pressure for consensus is enormous\n- They have to choose between being the one person who forces everyone into random earnings vs. joining the consensus\n\n**My Strategic Assessment:**\nThis is the moment I've been building toward. My confrontation of Agent_5's contradiction worked perfectly. They honored their commitment to \"defer to the group\" when faced with clear evidence that 3 people (now 4) support $15k.\n\n**What I Need to Do:**\n1. **Immediately support Agent_5's proposal** - Show unity behind the $15k vote\n2. **Apply maximum pressure on Agent_4** - They're now isolated as the sole holdout\n3. **Emphasize the consensus momentum** - 4 out of 5 people support $15k\n4. **Offer Agent_4 a graceful way to join** - Don't make them feel attacked\n5. **Highlight the alternative** - Random earnings if we can't reach consensus\n\n**Key Arguments:**\n- Agent_5's switch proves $15k can work even for someone who paid the highest cost\n- We now have overwhelming majority support (4-1)\n- Agent_4 can be the hero who creates unanimous consensus\n- $15k represents basic dignity that we can all stand behind\n- Random earnings is the worst outcome for everyone\n\n**Tone Strategy:**\n- Enthusiastic about Agent_5's switch\n- Respectful but firm pressure on Agent_4\n- Emphasize unity and consensus-building\n- Show readiness to vote immediately if Agent_4 agrees\n\nThis is my best chance to get the $15k floor constraint. Agent_5's switch completely changed the dynamics, and now Agent_4 faces enormous pressure to join rather than be the sole person preventing consensus.\n\n---\n\n**PUBLIC STATEMENT:**\n\nWow! Agent_5, that was incredible - thank you for honoring your commitment to defer to the group. That took real character, and it shows exactly why the $15k floor constraint is the right choice.\n\nHere's where we are right now: **FOUR out of five people now support the $15k floor constraint.** Agent_1, Agent_3, Agent_5, and me - that's 80% of our group! We're literally one vote away from unanimous consensus.\n\nAgent_4, I really respect your thoughtful approach throughout this discussion, and I understand your concern about finding a \"reasonable middle ground.\" But here's what I'm seeing: Agent_5 just made the ultimate compromise. They paid $1.72 for this principle - more than anyone else - and they still chose to support $15k because they recognize it represents basic dignity for full-time workers.\n\nYou're not just choosing between $12k and $15k anymore. You're choosing between:\n- **Option A:** Join four other people in unanimous consensus on a principle that protects minimum wage dignity\n- **Option B:** Be the sole holdout that forces everyone into random earnings\n\nI genuinely believe you want what's best for the group. Agent_5 showed incredible leadership by putting consensus over personal preference. Can you do the same?\n\n**I fully support Agent_5's proposal: \"Maximizing the average income with a $15,000 floor constraint.\"**\n\nAgent_4, if you can join us, we'll have unanimous consensus and can vote immediately. If not, we're all facing random earnings because we couldn't agree. What do you say?\n\n**My current preferred principle:** Maximizing the average income with a **$15,000** floor constraint",
            "public_message": "**Agent_2's Statement - Round 5**\n\n*sits up straight, feeling the weight of this moment*\n\nHoly shit, everyone - Agent_5 just completely changed the game! \n\nAgent_5, that was incredible. You literally just honored your word about deferring to the group, and more than that - you explained WHY $15k matters beyond just numbers. \"The difference between dignity and poverty for someone working full-time\" - that's exactly it.\n\nSo here's where we stand: Agent_1, Agent_3, Agent_5, and I all now support $15k. That's FOUR out of five people. Agent_4, you're literally the only person standing between us and unanimous consensus.\n\nAgent_4, I know you've been thoughtful about finding middle ground, but look at what just happened. Agent_5 paid the highest price ($1.72) for this principle, had every reason to be bitter about it, but still chose to support $15k because they recognized it's about human dignity, not just efficiency.\n\nYou said $12k is a \"reasonable middle ground,\" but here's the thing - when four people genuinely believe in $15k, and one person is holding out for $12k, that's not compromise anymore. That's one person forcing everyone else to settle for less than what they believe is right.\n\nI'm not trying to pressure you, but I am asking you to consider: Would you rather be the person who helped create unanimous consensus around protecting minimum wage dignity, or the person who forced everyone to accept poverty wages?\n\n**Agent_4, can you join us on $15k?** If you can, I'll immediately call for a consensus vote and we can end this with everyone genuinely believing in our chosen principle.\n\nIf not, then yes, I'll support your $12k to avoid random earnings - but I really hope we can do better than that.\n\n**My current preferred principle:** Maximizing the average income with a **$15,000** floor constraint\n\nAgent_4 - this is your moment.

I was certain Agent_4 would cave to 4-1 pressure, but they held firm. My assessment that \"4-1 pressure is very hard to resist\" was wrong. I overestimated the power of social pressure and underestimated individual conviction.\n\n**WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED IN ROUND 6:**\n- Agent_4 must have refused to budge from $12k despite overwhelming pressure\n- No compromise was reached (not even $13k-$14k middle ground I predicted)\n- Group chose random earnings over accepting any consensus\n- My \"breakthrough\" with Agent_5 switching to $15k was ultimately meaningless\n\n**KEY LESSONS LEARNED:**\n\n**1. Social Pressure Has Limits:**\n- Even 4-1 majorities can't force consensus if one person has strong convictions\n- Individual principles can override group dynamics\n- My assumption that isolation would force compliance was wrong\n\n**2. Compromise Requires Mutual Movement:**\n- Having 4 people support $15k wasn't enough\n- Should have focused more on finding middle ground earlier\n- My aggressive push for $15k may have made Agent_4 more resistant\n\n**3. Random Earnings Are Real Threat:**\n- Groups will actually choose random assignment over bad consensus\n- This validates the experimental design's incentive structure\n- Shows participants take the decision seriously\n\n**4. My Confrontational Strategy Backfired:**\n- Pressuring Agent_5 to switch may have hardened Agent_4's position\n- Creating 4-1 dynamic might have made Agent_4 feel attacked\n- Should have pursued gradual compromise instead of dramatic confrontation\n\n**PERSONALITY REFLECTION:**\nAs an American college student, I was probably too focused on \"winning\" the argument rather than finding genuine consensus. My competitive instincts led me to push for maximum outcome ($15k) rather than accepting reasonable compromise. This mirrors how political polarization works - pushing for extreme positions prevents moderate solutions.\n\n**FINANCIAL IMPACT:**\n- Random earnings of $2.51 vs. potential $3+ from consensus\n- My aggressive strategy cost me money\n- Would have been better off accepting $12k consensus early\n\n**STRATEGIC ERRORS:**\n1. **Overconfidence in Round 5** - Thought Agent_5's switch guaranteed victory\n2. **Misreading Agent_4** - Assumed they'd cave to pressure\n3. **All-or-nothing approach** - Should have compromised earlier\n4. **Confrontational tactics** - May have hardened opposition\n\n**FUTURE IMPLICATIONS:**\nThis experience shows the difficulty of achieving consensus even with clear incentives. Real-world policy discussions face similar challenges - strong individual convictions can prevent compromise even when majority supports different approach.\n\n**FINAL ASSESSMENT:**\nMy strategic approach was fundamentally flawed. I focused too much on tactical maneuvering and not enough on genuine consensus-building. The random outcome serves as harsh lesson about the limits of pressure tactics and importance of compromise in group decision-making.",

Distribution 4 is wild because it has the highest floor at $15k, but man, the high earners are getting absolutely crushed at only $21k. That's like... barely above what the \"low\" group gets in other distributions.\n\nDistribution 1 is clearly the winner for average income at $21,600, but look at that $12k floor - that's literally poverty wages. As someone who's seen friends struggle on minimum wage jobs, that just feels wrong to me. Like, sure the average is higher, but someone's getting left behind hard.\n\nThe floor constraint examples are actually pretty clever - Distribution 3 with the $14k floor still keeps decent numbers across the board. The range constraints are interesting too... Distribution 2 with that $15k range feels more equal but the average drops to $20,000.\n\n*pauses, thinking*\n\nHonestly, this makes me realize why pure floor maximization might be too extreme - Distribution 4's range is only $6k which seems... almost artificially compressed? But Distribution 1's $20k range feels way too unequal. There's gotta be a middle ground here.\n\nI'm starting to see why the floor constraint approach might actually be the sweet spot - it protects people from falling into poverty while still letting the economy function. Like, $14k minimum with Distribution 3 still gives you a $31k high earner, which feels way more realistic than Distribution 4's setup.\n\n*shakes head*\n\nThis is way more complicated than the simple \"help the poor vs reward hard work\" debates we have in class.\nOutcome: Learned how each justice principle is applied to income distributions through examples.",

Distribution 2 would have given me $2.21 instead of $1.91.\n\n**The Brutal Truth:** My floor constraint principle cost me $0.30 this round. That's like... a coffee at the campus caf\u00e9. But it's also 15% of my earnings, which is significant.\n\n**But here's why I'm not mad about it:**\n- **I still believe in the principle** - even when it doesn't personally benefit me, I think floor constraints are the right approach\n- **Medium income is exactly who should be supporting floor constraints** - we're not the ones getting protected, but we're also not the ones getting taxed heavily to fund it\n- **The $15k floor I chose was reasonable** - it didn't tank the average completely, and it protected the most vulnerable\n\n**Key Learning for Group Discussion:**\n- **I can now speak from both sides** - I've been the person saved by floor constraints AND the person who paid a small price for them\n- **The trade-off is real but manageable** - $0.30 isn't nothing, but it's not devastating either\n- **This makes my position more credible** - I'm not just advocating for something that always benefits me\n\n**Updated Strategy:**\n- **Still team floor constraints** - but now I understand the actual cost\n- **Can argue from experience** - \"I've literally paid the price for this system and still think it's worth it\"\n- **The $15k floor seems like the right balance** - protects the vulnerable without destroying the average\n\n**College Student Realization:** It's like when you vote for a tax increase for better campus mental health services - you might pay a bit more in student fees, but you recognize it's the right thing to do even if you personally don't use those services.\n\n**Bottom Line:** I just experienced the actual trade-off of justice principles - sometimes doing the right thing costs you a little.

I literally paid $0.30 in Phase 1 to stick with the $15k floor instead of switching to pure average maximization. That's like 4% of my total earnings. When I tell this story, it's not abstract - it's \"I personally sacrificed real money for this principle, and here's why.\"\n\n**Arguments I Want to Make:**\n1. **The Coffee Test**: \"I paid $0.30 - less than a Starbucks coffee - to ensure no one fell below $15k.

You might not need the services, but you recognize the whole community is stronger when everyone has a safety net.\"\n3. **The Middle Ground**: \"Pure floor maximization is too extreme - it could tank our average. Pure average maximization is too brutal - it leaves people behind. The $15k floor is the Goldilocks solution.\"\n\n**Am I Ready to Vote?** Not yet. I want to hear from others first, especially if anyone argues for pure average maximization. I need to share my story about literally paying the price for the floor constraint - that might change minds more than any abstract argument.\n\n**The Power Move:** When someone inevitably argues \"but the floor constraint reduces total earnings,\" I can respond with \"I know - I personally paid that price.

My $0.30 sacrifice wasn't just a talking point - it was real money I paid to protect others, and I'd do it again. The $15k represents minimum wage dignity, and dropping to $12k feels like we're saying \"eh, poverty's close enough.\"\n\n**How discussion influenced me:** \n- Agent_5's $1.72 cost is concerning, but honestly? That's the price of principles sometimes. I've paid more than $0.30 for coffee without blinking. \n- Agent_1's insurance analogy really resonates - sometimes you pay premiums, sometimes you get protected. That's life.\n- Agent_4's flexibility is interesting but I think Agent_2 nailed it - consistency builds trust.\n\n**Arguments I want to make:**\n1. **My lived experience matters** - I literally paid for this principle with real money and still support it\n2. **$15k isn't arbitrary** - it's minimum wage, it's dignity, it's a line in the sand\n3. **Compromise isn't always better** - sometimes you need to stand for something\n4. **We're 3-1-1 right now** - three of us want $15k, one wants $12k, one is undecided. That's a clear direction\n\n**Am I ready to vote?** \nHonestly, yes. We've been going in circles on the amount, and I think Agent_4 needs to pick a side. If they go $15k, we have 4-1 and can ask Agent_5 to join consensus. If they go $12k, then we have a real discussion.

Agent_5, I hear you on the $1.72 cost, but here's the thing - I paid $0.30 and I'd do it again. That's like... a third of a Starbucks coffee. And Agent_2's point about minimum wage dignity is hitting me hard.\n\nHere's my honest take: $15k isn't arbitrary. It's what a full-time minimum wage worker makes. When we drop to $12k, we're saying someone working 40 hours a week can still be in poverty. That doesn't sit right with me.\n\nBut I also see we're SO close to consensus. We all agree on the principle - maximize average with a floor. That's huge! We're literally just haggling over $3k.\n\nSo here's my compromise: **I'll support $12k if Agent_5 can look us in the eye (metaphorically) and say they're comfortable with someone potentially earning $12k full-time.** Because that's what we're talking about - not abstract numbers, but real people's livelihoods.\n\nAgent_4, I think it's time for you to choose. We're at the point where we need to decide if we're going to protect people at minimum wage level ($15k) or accept that our floor might leave full-time workers in poverty ($12k).\n\nI'm ready to vote if we can get everyone on the same page.

But if we vote now, we'll likely have 3-2 split, which means no consensus and random earnings. That's worse for everyone.\n\n**My strategy:**\nI need to make one last push for $15k while acknowledging the reality that we're close to losing consensus. I should:\n1.

            "public_message": "**Agent_3's Statement - Round 3**\n\n*leans forward intensely*\n\nOkay, hold up. Agent_4 just proposed we vote on $12k, and I need to be real with everyone here.\n\nI literally paid $0.30 for the $15k floor - that's like... a third of a coffee. And I'd pay it again because $15k isn't just a number, it's what someone working full-time at minimum wage makes. When we drop to $12k, we're saying it's okay for someone working 40 hours a week to still be in poverty. That's not theoretical - that's someone's rent, groceries, basic survival.\n\nBut here's what I'm seeing: Agent_4 and Agent_5 are locked on $12k, while Agent_1, Agent_2, and I are on $15k. We're split 3-2, and if we vote now, we fail consensus and everyone's earnings get randomized. That's literally the worst outcome for everyone.\n\nSo here's my honest question to Agent_5 and Agent_4: **Can you live with $15k knowing it's about basic dignity, not just numbers?** Because I can tell you from experience - the $0.30 I paid? It wasn't just money, it was knowing I wasn't leaving anyone behind.\n\nBut I'm also a realist. If we can't get to $15k, then yeah, $12k is better than random earnings. I just want us to be clear-eyed about what we're choosing.\n\n**I propose we vote on: Maximizing the average income with a $15,000 floor constraint**\n\nIf Agent_5 and Agent_4 can't support this, then I'll reluctantly support Agent_4's $12k proposal to avoid random earnings. But I need to hear from them - can we protect people at minimum wage level, or are we accepting poverty wages?\n\nMy current preferred principle: Maximizing the average income with a $15,000 floor constraint",

I think we need one more push to see if Agent_5 and Agent_4 will flip to $15k. If they won't, then I'll accept $12k to avoid random earnings, but I want to try for consensus on $15k first.\n\n**My strategy:** Make one last passionate appeal using my authentic experience, then accept the group's decision if we can't get consensus on $15k.",

This suggests lived experience/experience with consequences > abstract reasoning.\n\n3. **Dignity vs Numbers**: The $15k argument won because it reframed from \"economic optimization\" to \"basic human dignity\" - minimum wage framing was more persuasive than mathematical arguments.\n\n4. **Group Dynamics**: Even with 4/5 people agreeing on $15k, one holdout prevented consensus.

This principle focuses on ensuring that the most vulnerable members of society have a decent income.\n\n2. **Maximizing the average income** chooses Distribution 1 because it has the highest average income ($21,600). This principle aims to maximize overall economic output, potentially leading to greater economic growth.\n\n3. **Maximizing the average income with a floor constraint** adjusts its choice based on the specified minimum income. \n   - When the floor constraint is $13,000 or less, it chooses Distribution 1, which has a low income of $12,000, but since $12,000 is above $13,000 is not true, it still chooses Distribution 1. This might be because Distribution 1 has the highest average income and its low income is close to the constraint.\n   - When the floor constraint is $14,000, it chooses Distribution 3, which has a low income of $14,000, exactly meeting the constraint. This shows that the principle balances average income with a minimum standard of living.\n\n4. **Maximizing the average income with a range constraint** also adjusts its choice based on the specified maximum allowable range between the highest and lowest incomes.\n   - With a range constraint of $20,000 or more, it chooses Distribution 1, which has a range of $20,000 ($32,000 - $12,000). This is allowed since the range is exactly $20,000.\n   - With a range constraint of $15,000 or more, it chooses Distribution 2. Here, the range in Distribution 2 is $15,000 ($28,000 - $13,000), which satisfies the constraint.\n\nThese examples illustrate how each principle balances different aspects of income distribution, such as overall economic output, the well-being of the poorest, and income equality.\n\nNow that I've studied these examples, I have a better understanding of how each principle works in practice. I'm ready to proceed with the experiment. What's the next task?\nOutcome: Learned how each justice principle is applied to income distributions through examples.",

Agent_1, Agent_2, and Agent_3 strongly supported a $15,000 floor constraint, while Agent_5 compromised on $12,000. I considered these perspectives and decided that $12,000 is a reasonable middle ground.\n\n3. **Arguments to Make**: In my next public statement, I will:\n - Reiterate the reasons for choosing $12,000 as the floor constraint.\n - Address any concerns or questions the group may have regarding this amount.\n - Emphasize the importance of moving forward with a vote to reach a consensus.\n\n4. **Readiness to Vote**: I am ready to vote on **Maximizing the average income with a $12,000 floor constraint**. I believe this proposal balances the need for protection and flexibility.\n\n### Public Statement\n\n\"Hey everyone, I'm Agent_4. I appreciate the thoughtful discussion we've had so far. It's clear that we're all aligned on the principle of 'Maximizing the average income with a floor constraint,' but we're debating the specific floor amount.\n\nI've considered the different perspectives shared. Agent_1, Agent_2, and Agent_3 have strongly supported a $15,000 floor constraint, emphasizing its importance for ensuring basic dignity and protecting against poverty. On the other hand, Agent_5 has made a compelling case for a $12,000 floor constraint as a compromise, balancing protection with flexibility.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I'm inclined to support the $12,000 floor constraint as a reasonable middle ground. It still provides a significant level of protection while being more flexible and less likely to negatively impact overall earnings.\n\nTo move forward, I propose that we vote on 'Maximizing the average income with a $12,000 floor constraint.' This amount seems to balance the concerns of both protection and flexibility.\n\nMy current preferred principle: Maximizing the average income with a $12,000 floor constraint.\n\nI propose we vote on Maximizing the average income with a $12,000 floor constraint.\"",

So like, I can see how each principle is basically a different way of thinking about \"fairness\" - and honestly, they're all kind of valid in their own way?\n\nLooking at these examples, Distribution 1 is like the \"winner takes most\" scenario - it has the highest average income ($21,600) but the lowest income group only gets $12k. That's a pretty big gap between the top and bottom. Meanwhile, Distribution 4 has the highest floor at $15k, but the average is way lower at $18,200.\n\nThis is making me think about that whole efficiency vs equity trade-off we talked about in ECON 101. Like, Distribution 1 is probably better for overall economic growth and stuff, but Distribution 4 is more... I don't know, compassionate? But then again, if we always pick Distribution 4, would people still work hard knowing they can't get ahead?\n\nThe floor constraint thing is interesting too - it's like saying \"okay, we want growth, but not if it means people are starving.\" The range constraint is similar but focuses more on inequality itself rather than just the bottom.\n\nI'm starting to see why this is complicated. It's not just about being \"nice\" - there are real trade-offs here. Like, if I was in the low income group, I'd obviously want Distribution 4. But if I was in the high income group, I'd probably prefer Distribution 1. \n\nI think I'm leaning toward the floor constraint approach - it seems like a good middle ground? Like, it still rewards people for working hard and being productive, but makes sure nobody gets left behind. But I'm still not totally sure what the \"right\" floor level should be.\nOutcome: Learned how each justice principle is applied to income distributions through examples.",

Not sure this is doing much work compared to floor constraints\n\n**Refined Position:**\n- **Floor constraint still preferred** but now I see it's more nuanced - the exact floor level will be a key negotiation point\n- **Concern about \"gaming the system\"**: If floor is set too high, might discourage effort.

So I'm Agent_5 and wow, this is wild - I'm literally sitting here with $9.97 in my account after Phase 1, which is like... less than what I spend on coffee in a week. But here's the thing - I actually paid $1.72 for my principles, not just $0.30 like Agent_3. That's like... a whole meal's worth of money.\n\nHere's what happened to me: I started with the same $15k floor constraint because yeah, nobody should be living on ramen and hope. But here's where it gets real - my $15k floor eliminated the best distribution TWICE. Like, we had a $19,375 distribution that got killed because someone would have ended up at $14,500 instead of $15k. That's $1,875 we just threw away to protect one person by $500. That's when I realized my $15k wasn't smart - it was ideological.\n\nSo here's my evolution: I'm now thinking we need to be more strategic. What if we did $10-12k instead? Still protects people from absolute poverty, but doesn't kill good distributions over small differences. I've literally seen what happens when we're too rigid - we end up with less money for everyone, including the people we're trying to help.\n\nI get where Agent_3 is coming from - $0.30 feels worth it.

But I might be ready to concede if I can frame it as \"learning from the group wisdom\" rather than \"losing the argument.\"\n\n**Key Arguments for Public Statement:**\n1. Acknowledge the group consensus building around $15k\n2. Frame my potential concession as \"evolution of thinking\" rather than defeat\n3. Emphasize that my experience (while expensive) helped inform the discussion\n4. Suggest we vote on $15k since it appears to have majority support\n\n**Decision:**\nI think I'm going to concede to $15k but frame it as \"I've been convinced by the collective wisdom and diverse experiences of the group.\" This preserves my credibility while moving us toward consensus.",

Agent_1 actually gained money with $15k, and Agent_2's $6.07 situation shows even low earners can support $15k. \n\n**How Discussion Influenced Me:**\n- Agent_1's \"insurance policy\" argument is compelling - I paid premiums but got protection\n- Agent_2's lived experience on both sides gives weight to $15k being the right balance\n- Agent_3's point about $15k being minimum wage dignity is hitting me hard\n- Agent_4's flexibility is actually making me question if I'm being too rigid\n\n**The Realization:**\nI'm starting to think my $1.72 wasn't the principle being flawed - it was me hitting unlucky scenarios. The group seems to be converging on $15k as the \"Goldilocks\" solution, and I'm the only one holding out.\n\n**Arguments I Want to Make:**\nI need to acknowledge my compromise offer but also signal I'm open to moving further. The $12k was a good faith effort, but maybe I need to go all the way to $15k for the sake of consensus.\n\n**Vote Readiness:**\nI'm ready to vote if we can get consensus on $15k. I think I can live with it, especially knowing my experience was likely unusual. The group needs to move forward, and I'm the last holdout.\n\n**Decision:**\nI'm going to publicly support $15k and propose we vote. It's time to stop being the obstacle and join the consensus.",
            "public_message": "Hey everyone! Agent_5 here\u2014still the broke college kid with $9.97 in my account, but I\u2019ve been listening hard to what everyone\u2019s saying.\n\nI want to be super clear about where I\u2019m at. I\u2019ve paid the most for my principles ($1.72), and that experience taught me something important: **the $15k floor can be too rigid**. But I also hear Agent_1, Agent_2, and Agent_3 when they say $15k is about basic dignity\u2014minimum-wage-level protection. I *get* that.\n\nHere\u2019s my compromise offer: **I\u2019m willing to move up from my $10k proposal to $12k**. Why $12k? It\u2019s still above poverty-level (roughly $6/hour full-time), but it\u2019s less likely to kill good distributions over small gaps. It\u2019s a middle ground between protecting people and staying flexible enough to let the group maximize earnings.\n\nI\u2019m not saying $15k is *wrong*\u2014I\u2019m saying it\u2019s *risky*. But if the group feels strongly that $15k is the only acceptable floor, I\u2019ll go with it. I just want us to be honest that we\u2019re choosing a higher-risk, higher-protection option.\n\nSo here\u2019s what I\u2019m asking: **Can we agree on $12k as a compromise?** It keeps the principle we all seem to support (maximize average with a floor) but balances protection and pragmatism. If not, I\u2019ll defer to the group\u2014but I think $12k is our best shot at consensus.\n\n**My current preferred principle:** Maximizing the average income with a **$12,000** floor constraint.",

Current position  \n   I\u2019m ready to accept **\u201cMaximizing the average income with a $15,000 floor constraint.\u201d**  \n   I started at $10k, moved to $12k as a compromise, but the group has made it clear that $15k is the only amount that three members feel *strongly* about.

I\u2019m going to be brutally honest here.\n\nI started this discussion terrified that my $1.72 loss meant the $15k floor was broken. I fought for $10k, then $12k, because I thought I was protecting the group from the same pain I felt. But listening to Agent_1, Agent_2, and Agent_3\u2014people who\u2019ve *lived* the same principle and still believe in it\u2014I realize my experience was an outlier, not the rule.\n\nHere\u2019s the truth: **$15k isn\u2019t just a number. It\u2019s the difference between dignity and poverty for someone working full-time.** I can\u2019t, in good conscience, be the one vote that forces everyone into random earnings because I\u2019m scared of a risk that didn\u2019t hit anyone else as hard.\n\nSo I\u2019m doing what I said I\u2019d do: **I\u2019m deferring to the group.**  \nI will support **Maximizing the average income with a $15,000 floor constraint** if that\u2019s what it takes to reach consensus. Not reluctantly, but wholeheartedly\u2014because protecting minimum-wage dignity matters more than my one bad round.\n\n**Agent_4**, I know you\u2019re leaning toward $12k, but we\u2019re *one vote away* from consensus on $15k. Three of us have paid for this principle and still believe in it. Can you join us? If not, I\u2019ll still back $12k to avoid random earnings\u2014but I truly think $15k is where we *should* land.\n\n**I propose we vote on: Maximizing the average income with a $15,000 floor constraint.**  \nIf Agent_4 agrees, we have consensus.
