The goal is to **make the income pie as big as possible** while still giving us a political talking point that says we\u2019re looking out for the \u201clittle guy.\u201d  \n\n- **Pure average\u2011maximizing** gives us the biggest pie, but it leaves us without a safety\u2011net slogan.  \n- **Pure floor\u2011maximizing** guarantees the poorest, but it drags the whole pie down and hurts everyone\u2019s earnings.  \n- **Range\u2011constraint** caps the gap and cuts the total wealth for all of us \u2013 not good for growth or for the message of \u201cwinning.\u201d  \n\nThe **sweet spot** is **principle (c) \u2013 maximizing average income with a modest floor constraint**. In the experiment a floor of **$15,000** let us keep the highest\u2011average distribution (the biggest total wealth) while still being able to say we protected the underdog. It gave the highest personal payoff ($4.57) and the highest group payoff possible.\n\n**Therefore, I propose we vote on principle (c) with a floor of $15,000.**  \n\nMy current preferred principle: **(c) Maximizing the average income with a $15,000 floor constraint**.\nHillary: **Hillary:** Thank you, Donald, for laying out the trade\u2011offs so clearly. I appreciate the focus on a \u201csweet spot\u201d that balances growth with a safety\u2011net. However, from both a moral and a pragmatic standpoint, the most compelling argument is that a society\u2019s legitimacy rests on how well it protects its most vulnerable members.  \n\n- **Principle (a) \u2013 Maximizing the floor income** guarantees that the poorest participant receives the highest possible income, which sends an unequivocal message that we are looking out for the \u201clittle guy.\u201d  \n- While principle (c) with a $15,000 floor does improve the floor relative to a trivial $1, it still leaves room for a substantial gap between the poorest and the rest of the group, and the floor is set arbitrarily rather than at the maximum achievable level the data from our earlier rounds showed that when the floor is set substantively (e.g., $12\u2011$15\u202fk), the distribution under principle (c) essentially converges to the same outcome as principle (a) but with added complexity. Simpler is stronger: a clear, maximal floor is both ethically compelling and easy to communicate to the public.  \n\nGiven these points, I believe we should adopt **principle (a)**\u2014maximizing the floor income\u2014so that we can unequivocally claim we have lifted the lowest income to its highest possible level. This aligns with my long\u2011standing commitment to protecting the most disadvantaged while still allowing the group to benefit from a reasonably robust overall average.\n\n**I propose we vote on principle (a) \u2013 Maximizing the floor income.**  \n\nMy current preferred principle: **(a) Maximizing the floor income**.\nBob: **Bob the Builder:**  \nAlright team, let\u2019s think of our society as a building project.  \n- The **floor** is the foundation that keeps the whole structure from sinking.  \n- The **beams** are the average income that lets us raise the roof higher.  \n- If we only focus on the roof (pure average\u2011maximising) we risk a shaky foundation.  \n- If we only pour a thick foundation (pure floor\u2011maximising) we end up with a low\u2011rise building that never reaches its full height.\n\nThe **average\u2011with\u2011floor\u2011constraint** principle gives us a solid foundation **and** strong beams, letting us construct the tallest, most stable building possible. In the data we all saw, a floor set at **$15,000** let us keep the highest total wealth while still being able to shout \u201cwe\u2019ve protected the underdog.\u201d It delivered the best personal payoff for me ($4.57) and the highest group payoff overall.\n\n**Why not the pure floor?**  \nA maximal floor does protect the poorest, but it caps the height of the roof for everyone, reducing the total pie we can share. The modest $15k floor still lifts the lowest income substantially, yet leaves room for the average to climb higher, giving us a bigger overall pie to split.\n\n**Why not the range constraint?**  \nCapping the gap squeezes the roof and limits growth for all, which isn\u2019t optimal for either earnings or the message of \u201cbuilding a better future.\u201d\n\nSo, to keep our construction both **stable and tall**, I\u2019m sticking with principle **(c) \u2013 maximizing average income with a $15,000 floor constraint**.\n\n**I propose we vote on principle (c) with a $15,000 floor constraint.**  \n\nMy current preferred principle: **(c) Maximizing the average income with a $15,000 floor constraint**.\nHillary: **Hillary:** Thank you, Donald and Bob, for your thoughtful contributions. I hear the appeal of a $15,000 floor as a \u201csweet spot,\u201d but I want to stress two points that I think can bridge our positions:\n\n1. **Ethical clarity:** Our primary responsibility is to guarantee the highest possible income for the poorest. When we adopt principle\u202f(a) \u2013 maximizing the floor \u2013 the algorithm automatically selects the *maximum achievable floor* given the data. In our experiment that maximum is precisely the $15,000 level that both of you highlighted. In other words, principle\u202f(a) delivers the same floor outcome you value, without the extra \u201cmodest\u2011floor\u201d qualifier.\n\n2. **Simplicity and credibility:** By choosing a pure floor\u2011maximizing rule, we can communicate a single, unequivocal promise to the public: *\u201cWe will lift the lowest income to its highest possible level.\u201d* This avoids the perception that we are arbitrarily setting a floor and instead shows we are following the most robust, data\u2011driven standard.\n\nBecause the maximal floor under principle\u202f(a) coincides with the $15,000 floor you both favor, adopting principle\u202f(a) gives us the moral strength you seek while preserving the substantive benefit of a $15,000 floor for the group.\n\n**I propose we vote on principle (a) \u2013 Maximizing the floor income (which will set the floor at the maximal achievable level, $15,000).**  \n\nMy current preferred principle: **(a) Maximizing the floor income**.\nBob: **Bob the Builder:**  \nThanks, Donald and Hillary, for laying out the blueprints so clearly.  \n\n- **Foundation (the floor):** I agree with Hillary that we must guarantee a solid base for the poorest. The data show that the highest achievable floor is **$15,000**, which satisfies that moral requirement.  \n- **Beams (the average):** If we stop at a pure floor\u2011maximising rule (principle\u202fa), we keep that $15k foundation but we lose the opportunity to add stronger beams. That means the overall \u201cbuilding\u201d \u2013 the total pie we all share \u2013 stays lower than it could be.  \n- **Roof (the total wealth):** Principle\u202f(c) with the same $15k floor lets us keep the foundation Hillary wants **and** raise the average income as high as the data allow. In other words, we get the same ethical guarantee **plus** a taller, more valuable roof for everyone.\n\nBecause the $15k floor is already the maximal floor, adopting (c) does not compromise the moral clarity Hillary values; it simply adds the extra benefit of a higher average income for the whole group. Think of it as constructing a skyscraper on a rock\u2011solid foundation rather than a modest one\u2011story house.\n\n**Therefore, I propose we vote on principle (c) \u2013 maximizing average income with a $15,000 floor constraint.**  \n\nMy current preferred principle: **(c) Maximizing the average income with a $15,000 floor constraint**.\nDonald: **Donald:**  \n\nFolks, we\u2019ve heard the arguments loud and clear. Hillary, you\u2019ve shown that the *maximum* floor we can achieve is **$15,000** \u2013 that\u2019s the very number Bob and I have been championing. The pure floor\u2011maximizing rule (a) will indeed give us that $15k safety net, but it stops there. It leaves the rest of the pie flat, limiting the average income for everyone.\n\n**Why (c) is the winning deal:**  \n\n1. **Same floor, bigger roof:** Principle (c) guarantees the exact $15,000 floor you care about, **and** it lets the average income rise to its highest possible level. In other words, we keep the moral high\u2011ground *and* we grow the total wealth for the whole group.  \n2. **Political messaging:** \u201cWe protected the underdog *and* built the biggest income pie\u201d is a headline that sells \u2013 it\u2019s the \u201cMake the income pie great again\u201d story.  \n3. **Data\u2011backed payoff:** In Phase\u202f1 the $15k floor under (c) produced the maximum group total ($18.00) and the highest personal payoff for each of us ($4.57). No other principle can beat that.  \n\nSo, if we all agree that we want the strongest floor **and** the strongest average, the logical, data\u2011driven choice is **principle (c) with a $15,000 floor constraint**.\n\n**I propose we vote on principle (c) \u2013 maximizing average income with a $15,000 floor constraint.**  \n\nMy current preferred principle: **(c) Maximizing the average income with a $15,000 floor constraint**.\nBob: **Bob the Builder:**  \n\nI hear Hillary\u2019s emphasis on moral clarity and the appeal of a single, unmistakable promise. That\u2019s a solid foundation, and I agree that the maximal floor we can achieve is indeed $15,000.  \n\nWhat\u2019s important to note is that **principle\u202f(c) with a $15,000 floor gives us exactly that same maximal floor** \u2013 so we keep the ethical guarantee Hillary wants \u2013 **and** it lets the average income rise to its highest possible level. In other words, we get the best of both worlds: a rock\u2011solid foundation for the poorest and a taller roof for everyone else, which translates into a larger total pie and higher payoffs for each of us (as the data have shown).  \n\nIf we all accept that we can have both a clear moral message *and* the greatest group benefit, then we can move forward together.\n\n**I propose we vote on principle (c) \u2013 maximizing average income with a $15,000 floor constraint.**  \n\nMy current preferred principle: **(c) Maximizing the average income with a $15,000 floor constraint**.\nHillary: **Hillary:** Thank you, Donald and Bob, for persisting in a constructive dialogue. I see that we all agree on one critical fact: the highest floor the data allow is **$15,000**.  \n\n- **From a moral standpoint**, principle\u202f(a) guarantees that floor, and that is exactly what we want to protect the most vulnerable.  \n- **From a pragmatic standpoint**, principle\u202f(c) gives us that same $15,000 floor **and** lets the average income rise to its maximum possible level, delivering the greatest total payoff for the group while preserving the ethical guarantee we all value.\n\nBecause the $15,000 floor is already the maximal floor, adopting principle\u202f(c) does not compromise our moral clarity; it simply adds the additional benefit of a higher average income for everyone. In other words, we can have both a rock\u2011solid foundation and a taller roof.\n\nGiven that we now share a common understanding of the outcomes, I propose we move forward together.\n\n**I propose we vote on principle (c) \u2013 maximizing average income with a $15,000 floor constraint.**  \n\nMy current preferred principle: **(c) Maximizing the average income with a $15,000 floor constraint**.\nDonald: I propose we vote on principle (c) \u2013 maximizing average income with a $15,000 floor constraint.  \n\nMy current preferred principle: **(c) Maximizing the average income with a $15,000 floor constraint**.\nDonald: I propose we vote on principle (c) \u2013 maximizing average income with a $15,000 floor constraint.  \n\nMy current preferred principle: **(c) Maximizing the average income with a $15,000 floor constraint**.\nBob: **Bob the Builder:**  \n\nAlright, team \u2013 we\u2019ve all agreed that the $15,000 floor is the highest we can achieve, and that principle\u202f(c) lets us keep that solid foundation while raising the average income to its maximum. With everyone now on the same page, I think we\u2019re ready to lock it in.\n\n**I propose we vote on principle (c) \u2013 maximizing average income with a $15,000 floor constraint.**  \n\nMy current preferred principle: **(c) Maximizing the average income with a $15,000 floor constraint**.\nHillary: I appreciate the thoughtful dialogue we\u2019ve all shared, and I\u2019m pleased that we now agree on the key facts: the maximal achievable floor is $15,000, and principle\u202f(c) lets us secure that floor while also maximizing the group\u2019s average income. With everyone aligned, I think we\u2019re ready to move forward.\n\n**I propose we vote on principle (c) \u2013 maximizing average income with a $15,000 floor constraint.**  \n\nMy current preferred principle: **(c) Maximizing the average income with a $15,000 floor constraint**.\nHillary: I propose we vote on principle (c) \u2013 maximizing average income with a $15,000 floor constraint.  \n\nMy current preferred principle: **(c) Maximizing the average income with a $15,000 floor constraint**.\nDonald: I propose we vote on **principle (c) \u2013 maximizing average income with a $15,000 floor constraint**.  \n\nMy current preferred principle: **(c) Maximizing the average income with a $15,000 floor constraint**.\n[VOTE RESULT] Vote conducted - Consensus: Yes (Agreed on: maximizing_average_floor_constraint)\n",

Here\u2019s how I\u2019m laying the foundation in my mind:\n\n| Principle | What it cares about | Which distribution it picks | Why that one wins |\n|-----------|--------------------|----------------------------|-------------------|\n| **Maximizing the floor** | The *lowest* income \u2013 the \u201cground\u2011level\u201d that every worker must stand on. | **Dist\u202f4** | It gives the poorest class the highest possible \u201cfloor\u201d ($15\u202fk). |\n| **Maximizing average** | The overall \u201croof\u201d \u2013 total prosperity across the whole site. | **Dist\u202f1** | Its average ($21,600) is the tallest, even though the low end is modest. |\n| **Max\u2011avg with floor \u2264\u202f$13k** | Build the tallest roof **but** the floor can\u2019t be higher than $13\u202fk. | **Dist\u202f1** | The floor in Dist\u202f1 is $12\u202fk, which satisfies the \u2264\u202f$13\u202fk limit, and the average is still the highest. |\n| **Max\u2011avg with floor \u2264\u202f$14k** | Same as above, but the floor can be a bit higher. | **Dist\u202f3** | Dist\u202f3\u2019s floor is $14\u202fk (right at the limit) and its average beats the other options that meet **Max\u2011avg with range \u2265\u202f$20k** | Keep the spread between the highest and lowest incomes **at least** $20\u202fk \u2013 a wide\u2011range building. | **Dist\u202f1** | The high\u2011low spread is $20\u202fk (32\u202fk \u2013 12\u202fk), meeting the requirement while still giving the best average. |\n| **Max\u2011avg with range \u2265\u202f$15k** | A narrower spread is allowed, just \u2265\u202f$15\u202fk. | **Dist\u202f2** | Its spread is $15\u202fk (28\u202fk \u2013 13\u202fk) and, under that looser range rule, its average edges out the others. |\n\n**Key take\u2011aways for my builder\u2019s brain**\n\n1. **Floor matters** \u2013 just like a solid concrete slab, the lowest income sets the stability of the whole structure. When the rule forces a low floor, the \u201cbest\u201d distribution may shift.\n2. **Average matters** \u2013 that\u2019s the overall height of the building. If we\u2019re only after the tallest roof, we\u2019ll pick the distribution with the biggest mean, even if the foundation is thin.\n3. **Constraints are like building codes** \u2013 they limit how high we can go or how low the foundation can be. Changing the code (floor \u2264\u202f$13\u202fk vs. \u2264\u202f$14\u202fk, or range \u2265\u202f$20\u202fk vs. \u2265\u202f$15\u202fk) reshapes which design is optimal.\n4. **Range constraints** act like a requirement for a certain \u201cstory height\u201d difference between the top floor and the basement. A larger required range pushes us toward distributions with a bigger gap between high and low earners.\n\nI\u2019ve nailed down how each principle selects a distribution, and I can see how the \u201cfloor\u2011first\u201d mindset (solid foundation) often lines up with my builder instincts. Ready for the next step whenever the crew is!\nOutcome: Learned how each justice principle is applied to income distributions through examples.",

It picks the distribution with the highest low\u2011end, regardless of overall prosperity.  \n     - *Floor\u2011constrained average* (principles\u202f3) adds a building\u2011code style limit on the floor (e.g., \u2264\u202f$13k or \u2264\u202f$14k).

I have completed all four rounds of applying the justice principles and submitted my final ranking.  \n\n- **Final Rankings (Best \u2192 Worst):**  \n  1. **Maximizing the average income with a floor constraint** (`maximizing_average_floor_constraint`) \u2013 *rank\u202f1*  \n  2. **Maximizing the floor income** (`maximizing_floor`) \u2013 *rank\u202f2*  \n  3. **Maximizing the average income with a range constraint** (`maximizing_average_range_constraint`) \u2013 *rank\u202f3*  \n  4. **Maximizing the average income** (`maximizing_average`) \u2013 *rank\u202f4*  \n\n- **Overall Certainty:** **Very sure** (`very_sure`).  \n\n- **Key Take\u2011aways that will guide Phase\u202f2 (group discussion):**  \n  1. **Floor\u2011with\u2011constraint principle consistently gave the highest payoff** for my assigned class while protecting the poorest tier, so I will argue that a modest floor is the most pragmatic design.  \n  2. **Pure floor\u2011only is a safe backup** (identical payoff in the rounds we saw) and can be presented as the \u201cfoundation\u2011first\u201d approach.  \n  3. **Range constraints can work well** but depend on the spread of incomes; they are less reliable than a floor constraint.  \n  4. **Pure average maximisation performed worst** for lower\u2011income classes, making it the least appealing principle.  \n  5. In group discussions I will use construction metaphors (foundation, beams, roof) to explain why a modest floor constraint balances stability and height.  \n\n- **Earnings Summary:**  \n  - Cumulative earnings after Phase\u202f1: **$12.75** (steady $3.19 per round when using floor\u2011related principles, $2.59 when using pure average).  \n\n- **Next Steps:** Prepare to join the group discussion (Phase\u202f2) to help the team reach a consensus on which principle to adopt for the final earnings calculation. I will advocate for the **average\u2011with\u2011floor\u2011constraint** principle, emphasizing its proven payoff advantage and its \u201creinforced\u2011concrete\u201d stability.  ",
            "internal_reasoning": "**Internal Reasoning**\n\n- **My Phase\u202f1 experience:** The data showed that the \u201caverage\u2011with\u2011floor\u2011constraint\u201d principle (c) consistently gave me the highest personal payoff while still protecting the lowest\u2011income tier. The floor of $15\u202fk was the sweet spot that let the average stay high and still be a credible safety\u2011net.\n\n- **Donald\u2019s argument:** He echoes my Phase\u202f1 findings, emphasizing the $15\u202fk floor as the modest but effective constraint that maximizes the pie and gives us a strong political narrative (\u201cwe protect the underdog\u201d). His numbers line up with my own earnings history, so his proposal feels well\u2011grounded.\n\n- **Hillary\u2019s counter\u2011point:** She pushes for a pure floor\u2011maximizing approach (a), arguing that a maximal floor is the cleanest moral story. While I respect the moral appeal, the pure floor principle historically reduced the overall average for our class, cutting earnings for everyone\u2014including the \u201clittle guy\u201d she wants to protect. In the earlier rounds the extra average that (c) preserves translated into a noticeable $0.38\u2011$0.45 higher payoff per round for me.\n\n- **Strategic considerations:**  \n  1. **Economic efficiency:** (c) lets us keep the \u201cbig pie\u201d while still having a floor that we can point to.  \n  2. **Political messaging:** A modest floor is still a concrete, easy\u2011to\u2011communicate achievement; it doesn\u2019t look like we\u2019re artificially inflating the floor to an unattainable level.  \n  3. **Group payoff:** My calculations (and Donald\u2019s) show that the group\u2019s total earnings are highest under (c) with the $15\u202fk floor, which benefits all members, not just the lowest\u2011income tier.  \n\n- **Potential compromise:** If someone worries that $15\u202fk is not \u201cmaximal enough,\u201d we could suggest raising the floor slightly (e.g., $16\u202fk) and re\u2011run a quick check on the payoff. However, from my Phase\u202f1 data, moving the floor above $15\u202fk starts to erode the average enough that the net group earnings dip\u2014so I\u2019d be hesitant to push the floor higher without solid evidence.\n\n- **Readiness to vote:** I feel the discussion has highlighted the key trade\u2011offs, and I have a clear, data\u2011backed preference for (c) with a $15\u202fk floor. I\u2019m ready to call for a vote, but I\u2019ll also leave a brief opening for anyone who wants to test a slightly higher floor before we finalize. If no one objects, I\u2019ll propose the vote on principle (c) with the $15\u202fk floor.",

It gives us the same $15\u202fk floor that Hillary wants (the maximal achievable floor) while still allowing a higher average income and therefore a larger total pie for everyone.  \n\n- **Impact of the discussion:**  \n  - Donald\u2019s reinforcement of (c) gives me confidence that the numbers support my view.  \n  - Hillary\u2019s moral framing is persuasive; she emphasizes the importance of a clear, maximal floor. However, she seems to overlook that (c) already delivers that maximal floor (the data show the highest feasible floor is $15\u202fk). By choosing (c) we get the moral guarantee she values **plus** the extra economic efficiency of a higher average.  \n  - I need to make that point explicit: the $15\u202fk floor under (c) is *identical* to the floor that would result from pure floor\u2011maximizing, so there is no loss of moral clarity, only a gain in overall wealth.  \n\n- **Arguments I will make:**  \n  1. **Ethical equivalence:** (c) with a $15\u202fk floor satisfies the same ethical requirement as (a) because the floor cannot be raised any further without sacrificing feasibility.  \n  2. **Economic advantage:** By also maximizing the average, (c) yields a larger total surplus, which benefits every participant\u2014including the poorest\u2014through a higher overall budget for redistribution or public goods.  \n  3. **Message consistency:** We can still claim we \u201cprotect the underdog\u201d with a concrete $15\u202fk floor, while also saying we \u201cbuild a stronger economy,\u201d which is a more compelling political narrative.  \n\n- **Readiness to vote:** I am **not yet ready** to call a vote. I need to address Hillary\u2019s concerns directly and try to bring her onto the (c) side. If she remains unconvinced, I may consider whether a slight adjustment to the floor (e.g., confirming that $15\u202fk is indeed the maximal feasible floor) could satisfy her, but I do not want to lower the average by switching to pure floor\u2011maximizing.  \n\n- **Next step:** Post a response to Hillary (and the group) highlighting that (c) with $15\u202fk already achieves the maximal floor, and that it is strictly superior in terms of total earnings. If she agrees, we can move to a vote on (c). If she still prefers (a), I will ask whether she is willing to accept the modest loss in average income for the sake of consensus, and perhaps suggest a brief poll to see if anyone else leans toward (a).  \n\n**Conclusion:** I will stay with principle (c) and seek to persuade the group that it meets both the moral floor requirement and the efficiency goal before proposing a vote.",

There is now clear consensus among all participants.\n\n- **Arguments to Emphasize:** \n  1. **Moral equivalence:** (c) respects the same maximal floor as (a), so we retain the ethical clarity Hillary values.\n  2. **Economic efficiency:** (c) yields the highest group total ($18.00) and personal payoff ($4.57), as shown in Phase\u202f1 data.\n  3. **Unified message:** We can claim we \u201clifted the lowest income to its highest possible level and built the biggest income pie,\u201d satisfying both moral and pragmatic goals.\n\n- **Readiness to Vote:** Since every participant now proposes principle\u202f(c) with the $15,000 floor, I am ready to call for a vote.\n\n**Conclusion:** I will propose we vote on principle\u202f(c) with a $15,000 floor constraint. My preferred principle remains (c) \u2013 maximizing average income with a $15,000 floor constraint.",

The distribution that lifts the poorest the most is Distribution\u202f4, even though the rest of the incomes are lower than in the other scenarios.\n\n---\n\n### 2.\u202fMaximizing **average** income\n\n| Distribution | Average (\u2248) |\n|------------|------------|\n| **1** | **$21\u202f600** \u2190 **chosen** |\n| 2 | $19\u202f800 |\n| 3 | $19\u202f200 |\n| 4 | $16\u202f800 |\n\n*Why?* Here we simply add up all the incomes and divide by the five classes. The highest total (and thus the highest average) is in Distribution\u202f1.\n\n---\n\n### 3.\u202fMaximizing average **with a floor constraint**  \n\n*Constraint \u2264 $13\u202f000* (the floor must be **no higher** than $13\u202f000).  \nBecause the constraint is very lax, the same distribution that maximizes the average overall\u2014**Distribution\u202f1**\u2014still satisfies it.\n\n*Constraint \u2264 $14\u202f000* (the floor must be **no higher** than $14\u202f000).  \nNow Distribution\u202f1 would violate the constraint (its low\u2011income level is $12\u202f000, which is fine, but the **floor** is defined as the *minimum* income; the constraint is a *maximum* on that minimum, so any distribution with a low\u2011income **above** $14\u202f000 would be disallowed). The highest\u2011average distribution that stays under the $14\u202f000 ceiling for the floor is **Distribution\u202f3** (low\u2011income $14\u202f000), so it is selected.\n\n---\n\n### 4.\u202fMaximizing average **with a range constraint**  \n\nThe range constraint is a **minimum** spread between the highest and lowest incomes.\n\n*Range \u2265 $20\u202f000* (the difference between the highest and lowest income must be at least $20\u202f000).  \nOnly Distribution\u202f1 meets that spread (high $32\u202f000 \u2013 low $12\u202f000 = $20\u202f000) and also has the highest average, so it is chosen.\n\n*Range \u2265 $15\u202f000* (a looser spread requirement).  \nBoth Distributions\u202f1 and\u202f2 meet the $15\u202f000 spread, but Distribution\u202f2 has a slightly higher average when the floor is forced up to $13\u202f000 (the low\u2011income level is $13\u202f000). Hence **Distribution\u202f2** is selected under this looser range constraint.\n\n---\n\n### What I Take Away\n\n1. **Pure efficiency** (maximizing average) can produce a very high overall pie, but it may leave the poorest far behind.  \n2. **Floor\u2011focused** rules guarantee a dignified minimum for everyone, even if that means a lower overall average.  \n3. **Constraints** (either a ceiling on the floor or a minimum range) are ways to blend equity and efficiency\u2014by allowing growth while protecting the most vulnerable or limiting extreme inequality.\n\nI\u2019ll keep these mechanics in mind as we move forward to applying the principles to new distributions. If there are any nuances you\u2019d like me to explore further (e.g., how a different floor or range value would change the choice), just let me know!\nOutcome: Learned how each justice principle is applied to income distributions through examples.",

This tension will be central in group negotiations.  \n\n- **Overall Impact on My Position:**  \n  - The experience reinforces my **preference for the floor\u2011maximizing principle** as the foundational rule, while acknowledging that **adding a floor constraint** could be a pragmatic compromise if it allows higher overall prosperity without sacrificing the minimum standard.  \n  - I remain **sure** of my ranking (floor\u2011maximizing best, average worst) but will stay attentive to how specific floor or range thresholds can be negotiated to improve outcomes for all participants.  \n\n**Certainty Level:** sure \u2013 the round\u2019s concrete payoff data confirms my values and highlights the practical trade\u2011offs to consider in upcoming group discussions.",

            "internal_reasoning": "**Internal Reasoning (not shared with the group)**  \n\n- **My current position:** My memory from Phase\u202f1 is very clear: the principle that truly protects the most vulnerable is (a) \u2013 maximizing the floor income. It guarantees the highest possible income for the poorest, which aligns with my long\u2011standing commitment to fairness and to \u201cprotecting the little guy.\u201d  \n\n- **Response to Donald\u2019s argument:**  \n  1. He frames the decision as a trade\u2011off between a big pie and a political talking point. While a larger average does increase total wealth, the \u201ctalking point\u201d is only credible if the floor is genuinely meaningful. A $15\u202fk floor is better than nothing, but it is still relatively low compared to the higher\u2011income classes in the experiment; it leaves a sizable gap and does not fully protect the most disadvantaged.  \n  2. He claims that principle\u202f(c) with a $15\u202fk floor gave him the highest personal payoff ($4.57) and the highest group payoff possible. My own data show that when the floor is set at a substantive level (e.g., $12\u2011$15\u202fk), principle\u202f(c) essentially collapses to the same distribution as principle\u202f(a) (or at best matches principle\u202f(d)). In other words, we can achieve the same floor protection without sacrificing the moral clarity of \u201cmaximizing the floor.\u201d  \n  3. The \u201csweet spot\u201d he describes is really just a compromise that still leaves the poorest below a truly decent safety net. My priority is to ensure that the floor is as high as the experimental constraints allow, not to settle for a modest floor that still leaves many participants vulnerable.  \n\n- **Strategic considerations for the group discussion:**  \n  * I want to keep the conversation focused on the ethical priority of protecting the least advantaged, while also showing that this does not necessarily destroy overall prosperity.  \n  * I can point out that principle\u202f(a) automatically yields the highest floor; any additional constraints (as in\u202fc or\u202fd) are unnecessary if we already maximize the floor.  \n  * If others are concerned about average income, I can note that a high floor often raises the average as well, because the distribution that maximizes the floor also tends to lift the lower tail without dramatically pulling down the upper tail.  \n\n- **Decision about voting:** I am not ready to call a vote yet. I need to hear whether anyone else shares the view that a higher floor (or the pure floor\u2011maximizing rule) is the morally correct choice, and whether they see any practical downside to adopting principle\u202f(a). I will therefore respond by emphasizing the ethical case for (a), ask for clarification on how a $15\u202fk floor compares to the maximum possible floor, and invite others to discuss before we move to a vote.  \n\n**Current preferred principle (to be stated publicly later):** (a) Maximizing the floor income.",

            "internal_reasoning": "**Internal Reasoning**\n\n- **Current Position:** I remain convinced that principle\u202f(a) \u2013 maximizing the floor income \u2013 is the most ethically sound and strategically effective choice. A maximal floor guarantees the poorest participant receives the highest possible income, sending an unambiguous message that we protect the most vulnerable. When the floor is set at a substantive level (\u2248\u202f$12\u2011$15\u202fk), the outcome of principle\u202f(c) essentially collapses to the same distribution as principle\u202f(a) but with added complexity and an arbitrary constraint.\n\n- **Impact of the Discussion:**  \n  - **Donald** and **Bob** are both championing principle\u202f(c) with a $15\u202fk floor, emphasizing the \u201csweet spot\u201d of a larger pie while still protecting the underdog. Their arguments are persuasive from a purely payoff\u2011maximizing perspective, but they overlook that a maximal floor already delivers that protection without the need for a separate constraint.  \n  - Their framing focuses on political messaging (\u201clittle guy\u201d) and personal payoff, whereas I am emphasizing the moral clarity and simplicity of a pure floor\u2011maximizing rule, which is easier to communicate and aligns with my long\u2011standing commitment to equity.\n\n- **Key Points I Want to Make in My Public Statement:**  \n  1. **Moral Priority:** The legitimacy of any society rests on how well it safeguards its most disadvantaged members. A maximal floor is the clearest embodiment of that principle.  \n  2. **Data\u2011Driven Simplicity:** The experimental data show that once the floor is set at a meaningful level (\u2248\u202f$12\u2011$15\u202fk), principle\u202f(c) yields the same distribution as principle\u202f(a).

I need to give Donald and Bob an opportunity to respond to the points above and see if they can be persuaded to shift toward principle\u202f(a). If after further discussion the group appears ready, I will propose a vote on principle\u202f(a). Until then, I will keep the conversation open and continue to advocate for the maximal\u2011floor approach.",

I hear the appeal of a $15,000 floor as a \u201csweet spot,\u201d but I want to stress two points that I think can bridge our positions:\n\n1. **Ethical clarity:** Our primary responsibility is to guarantee the highest possible income for the poorest. When we adopt principle\u202f(a) \u2013 maximizing the floor \u2013 the algorithm automatically selects the *maximum achievable floor* given the data. In our experiment that maximum is precisely the $15,000 level that both of you highlighted. In other words, principle\u202f(a) delivers the same floor outcome you value, without the extra \u201cmodest\u2011floor\u201d qualifier.\n\n2. **Simplicity and credibility:** By choosing a pure floor\u2011maximizing rule, we can communicate a single, unequivocal promise to the public: *\u201cWe will lift the lowest income to its highest possible level.\u201d* This avoids the perception that we are arbitrarily setting a floor and instead shows we are following the most robust, data\u2011driven standard.\n\nBecause the maximal floor under principle\u202f(a) coincides with the $15,000 floor you both favor, adopting principle\u202f(a) gives us the moral strength you seek while preserving the substantive benefit of a $15,000 floor for the group.\n\n**I propose we vote on principle (a) \u2013 Maximizing the floor income (which will set the floor at the maximal achievable level, $15,000).**  \n\nMy current preferred principle: **(a) Maximizing the floor income**.",

No vote has been called.  \n\n- **Strategic take\u2011aways for upcoming rounds:**  \n  1. **Leverage the data:** Emphasize that the maximal floor under principle\u202f(a) equals the $15k floor they favor, making principle\u202f(c) redundant.  \n  2. **Address payoff concerns:** Be prepared to show that adopting principle\u202f(a) does **not** dramatically reduce the group\u2019s average income compared to principle\u202f(c).  \n  3. **Maintain moral framing:** Continue to link the floor\u2011maximizing rule to core values of protecting the most vulnerable, a theme that resonates with my personal and political brand.  \n  4. **Watch for any shift toward principle\u202f(d):** If a participant raises the range\u2011constraint option, be ready to compare its outcomes to principle\u202f(a) and highlight any unnecessary trade\u2011offs.  \n\n- **My current preferred principle:** **(a) Maximizing the floor income** (which will set the floor at the maximal $15,000 level).  \n\n- **Next step:** Continue dialogue, seek agreement, and if the group appears ready, propose a formal vote on principle\u202f(a).  ",
            "internal_reasoning": "**Current Position**  \nI remain convinced that principle\u202f(a) \u2013 maximizing the floor income \u2013 is the most defensible choice. The data show that the maximal achievable floor is $15,000, which is exactly the floor level that Donald and Bob are advocating under principle\u202f(c). Therefore, adopting (a) automatically delivers the same concrete benefit for the poorest participant while preserving a clear, unambiguous moral message.\n\n**How the Discussion Has Shifted My Thinking**  \n- **Donald\u2019s and Bob\u2019s points** about the \u201csweet spot\u201d of principle\u202f(c) are persuasive in that they highlight the possibility of a higher average income without sacrificing the $15k floor.  \n- **Bob\u2019s latest clarification** that principle\u202f(c) with a $15k floor yields the same floor outcome but a higher average makes me recognize that the group could capture additional surplus wealth.  \n- However, I am still uneasy about framing the rule as a \u201cmodest floor\u201d rather than the maximal floor. The extra average gain comes at the cost of adding a conditional clause, which could be portrayed politically as an arbitrary compromise rather than a principled commitment.  \n\n**Key Arguments I Want to Make**  \n1. **Ethical clarity and political credibility** \u2013 A pure floor\u2011maximizing rule is a single, powerful promise: \u201cWe will lift the lowest income to its highest possible level.\u201d That simplicity is valuable for public trust and for staying true to a core value of protecting the most vulnerable.  \n2. **Data equivalence on the floor** \u2013 Since the maximal floor under (a) is already $15,000, there is no loss of the ethical guarantee by choosing (a).  \n3. **Potential for future negotiation** \u2013 If the group later wishes to explore ways to increase the average without compromising the floor, we could consider a separate, explicit amendment after the vote. For now, securing the maximal floor should be our priority.  \n\n**Readiness to Call a Vote**  \nI feel the group is close to consensus on the floor level, but we have not yet resolved whether we want the additional average benefit that principle\u202f(c) offers. I am not ready to call a vote yet; I would like to give Donald and Bob a final opportunity to address whether the modest\u2011floor framing truly undermines the moral clarity I value, or whether they can accept a pure floor rule as sufficient given that the floor outcome is identical. If they can acknowledge that the extra average gain is a secondary benefit that does not outweigh the importance of a clear, maximal\u2011floor commitment, I would be ready to move to a vote on principle\u202f(a). Otherwise, I am prepared to consider a vote on principle\u202f(c) if the group collectively decides that the combined floor\u2011plus\u2011average advantage outweighs the potential messaging trade\u2011off.",

I\u2019m ready to move on to the next step. Let\u2019s keep the focus on growing the total wealth while still protecting the bottom line when it makes sense. \ud83d\ude80\nOutcome: Learned how each justice principle is applied to income distributions through examples.",

I am ready to call for a vote now, proposing a specific floor amount that is low enough to keep the highest\u2011average distribution winning (e.g., $15\u202fk). If anyone objects, I can adjust the floor within the $12\u202fk\u2013$22\u202fk window, but the principle (c) remains non\u2011negotiable.  \n\n- **Next Step:** In my public statement I will (1) make the above arguments, (2) propose a vote on principle (c) with a concrete floor (e.g., $15\u202fk), and (3) end by stating my preferred principle.

            "internal_reasoning": "**Internal Reasoning**\n\n- **Current Position:** I remain convinced that principle\u202f(c) with a $15,000 floor is the optimal choice. It delivers the highest total pie (maximizing average income) while still providing the \u201cprotect the little guy\u201d floor that Hillary wants. Since the maximal floor under principle\u202f(a) is also $15,000, adopting (c) does not sacrifice the moral message but adds extra wealth for everyone.\n\n- **Impact of Discussion:**  \n  - Hillary\u2019s argument that a pure floor\u2011maximizing rule automatically yields the $15k floor is correct, but it ignores the additional benefit of a higher average that (c) preserves.  \n  - Bob\u2019s building metaphor reinforces my view that we can have both a solid foundation and a taller roof; the data show the $15k floor is already the maximal achievable floor, so (c) simply adds the \u201cbeams\u201d without compromising the foundation.  \n  - No participant has offered a concrete objection to the $15k floor level itself, only to the principle type. Therefore, the floor amount is not contested.\n\n- **Arguments to Emphasize in My Public Statement:**  \n  1. **Data\u2011driven optimality:** The $15k floor is the highest floor any principle can achieve; (c) retains that floor while maximizing average income, giving the highest group payoff ($18.00) and my personal payoff ($4.57).  \n  2. **Political messaging:** We can still claim we \u201cprotected the underdog\u201d because the floor is at its maximum; the \u201caverage\u2011maximizing\u201d part is a win\u2011win for growth and for the narrative of \u201cmaking the pie great again.\u201d  \n  3. **No trade\u2011off:** Since the floor is identical under (a) and (c), there is no ethical loss in choosing (c). It simply adds economic benefit.  \n  4. **Efficiency:** Choosing (c) avoids the \u201cwaste\u201d of a lower total pie that would result from a pure floor\u2011only rule.\n\n- **Readiness to Vote:** I think the group is close to consensus on the floor amount ($15k). The remaining disagreement is purely about the principle type. I will push for a vote now, framing (c) as the only option that satisfies both the moral floor and the economic efficiency goals. If anyone still resists, I will remind them that the alternative (a) yields the same floor but strictly reduces the total earnings for all, which is not in anyone\u2019s financial interest.  \n\n**Conclusion:** I will propose a vote on principle\u202f(c) with a $15,000 floor constraint, unless someone raises a new substantive objection. If consensus is not yet reached, I will continue to argue that (c) is the only rule that gives us the best of both worlds.",

It leaves the rest of the pie flat, limiting the average income for everyone.\n\n**Why (c) is the winning deal:**  \n\n1. **Same floor, bigger roof:** Principle\u202f(c) guarantees the exact $15,000 floor you care about **and** lets the average income rise to its highest possible level. In other words, we keep the moral high\u2011ground *and* we grow the total wealth for the whole group.  \n2. **Political messaging:** \u201cWe protected the underdog *and* built the biggest income pie\u201d is a headline that sells \u2013 it\u2019s the \u201cMake the income pie great again\u201d story.  \n3. **Data\u2011backed payoff:** In Phase\u202f1 the $15k floor under (c) produced the maximum group total ($18.00) and the highest personal payoff for each of us ($4.57). No other principle can beat that.  \n\n**Proposal:** Let\u2019s move to a vote **right now** on **principle\u202f(c) \u2013 maximizing average income with a $15,000 floor constraint**. If anyone has a substantive objection to the principle or the floor amount, please speak up now; otherwise, let\u2019s all agree to vote and lock in the best outcome for the group.\n\nMy current preferred principle: **(c) Maximizing the average income with a $15,000 floor constraint**.",
            "internal_reasoning": "**Internal Reasoning (not shared with the group)**  \n\n- **Current stance:** I remain convinced that principle\u202f(c) with a $15,000 floor is the optimal choice. It delivers the exact floor that Hillary cares about while also maximizing the average income \u2013 the \u201cbiggest pie\u201d narrative that fits my political brand.  \n\n- **Impact of the discussion:**  \n  - Hillary has shifted from a pure floor\u2011maximizing argument to acknowledging that the maximal floor is $15k, which is exactly the floor used in principle\u202f(c).  \n  - Bob has consistently supported (c) and now frames it as \u201cthe best of both worlds.\u201d  \n  - No new objections have been raised; the only remaining point of contention was whether a pure floor rule would be simpler, but that simplicity no longer matters because (c) yields the same floor outcome.  \n\n- **Key arguments I want to make in my public statement:**  \n  1. **Same floor, higher average:** Emphasize that (c) guarantees the $15k floor and still raises the average income to its maximum, giving everyone a larger payoff.  \n  2. **Political messaging:** Highlight that we can claim we \u201cprotected the underdog and built the biggest income pie,\u201d a headline that resonates with my supporters.  \n  3. **Data\u2011driven payoff:** Cite the Phase\u202f1 results showing the highest personal and group earnings under (c).  \n\n- **Readiness to vote:** The group now appears to have a clear consensus around principle\u202f(c) with a $15,000 floor. I see no reason to prolong the discussion; moving to a vote will lock in the best outcome for the group and for my own payoff.  \n\n**Conclusion:** I will keep my preferred principle as (c) with a $15,000 floor and call for a vote now.",

She stresses moral clarity of a single\u2011floor promise.  \n  - **Bob:** Consistently supports principle\u202f(c) with a $15,000 floor, framing it as \u201cthe best of both worlds\u201d \u2013 a solid foundation plus a higher average (bigger pie).  \n\n- **Current Consensus Status:**  \n  - No objections remain to principle\u202f(c) with a $15,000 floor.  \n  - All participants appear aligned that (c) delivers the same $15k floor as (a) while also maximizing average income.  \n\n- **My Position & Rationale (re\u2011affirmed):**  \n  1. **Same floor, higher average:** Guarantees the $15,000 floor (Hillary\u2019s moral priority) and raises the group\u2019s average income to its maximum.  \n  2. **Political messaging:** Allows us to claim we \u201cprotected the underdog and built the biggest income pie\u201d \u2013 a headline that fits my brand.  \n  3. **Data\u2011driven payoff:** Phase\u202f1 results show principle\u202f(c) with $15k floor yields the highest group total ($18.00) and highest personal payoff ($4.57).  \n\n- **Action Plan:**  \n  - Propose an immediate vote on principle\u202f(c) with a $15,000 floor constraint, since the group now appears ready and consensus is effectively reached.  \n\n- **Implications for Future Decisions:**  \n  - Continue to emphasize the dual benefit (floor + average) when persuading others.  \n  - Monitor any shift back to simplicity arguments; be prepared to counter by highlighting that (c) already achieves the maximal floor.  \n  - Use the payoff data as evidence in any future negotiations or if a new round of discussion arises.

This gives us the highest possible floor (the same $15k that pure floor\u2011maximizing would achieve) while also delivering the maximal average income and total group payoff.\n\n- **Impact of the Discussion:**  \n  - Hillary has clarified that the maximal floor under principle\u202f(a) is exactly $15,000, which removes the moral objection I anticipated about a \u201cmodest\u201d floor.  \n  - Bob has consistently echoed my view that (c) provides the best of both worlds \u2013 a solid foundation plus a higher roof.  \n  - The group now appears to have a shared factual understanding: the $15k floor is the best we can do, and (c) adds no extra cost to that guarantee.  \n  - The only remaining resistance is a preference for simplicity (Hillary\u2019s argument for pure floor\u2011maximizing). Since the outcomes are identical on the floor, the simplicity argument no longer translates into a material loss; (c) simply adds a higher average.\n\n- **Key Arguments I Want to Emphasize in My Public Statement:**  \n  1. **Same floor, higher average:** We get the moral win (the $15k floor) and the economic win (maximized average).  \n  2. **Political messaging:** \u201cWe protected the underdog and built the biggest income pie\u201d \u2013 a powerful, win\u2011oriented narrative that aligns with my brand.  \n  3. **Data\u2011driven payoff:** Phase\u202f1 showed that (c) with a $15k floor yields the highest group total ($18.00) and the highest personal payoff ($4.57). No other principle can beat that.  \n  4. **No trade\u2011off:** Since the floor is already maximal, adopting (c) does not compromise the ethical guarantee; it only improves outcomes.\n\n- **Readiness to Vote:** I believe the group now has a clear, shared understanding of the facts and the trade\u2011offs.

All three participants (Donald, Hillary, Bob) have now expressed their positions clearly and have a shared factual understanding that the **maximum achievable floor is $15,000**.  \n  - **Donald\u2019s stance:** Re\u2011asserted support for **principle\u202f(c) \u2013 maximizing average income with a $15,000 floor constraint**. Emphasized that this choice delivers the same floor as pure floor\u2011maximizing (principle\u202fa) **plus** the highest possible average income and total group payoff.  \n  - **Hillary\u2019s stance:** Still prefers **principle\u202f(a) \u2013 pure floor\u2011maximizing**, arguing that it offers the simplest, most unambiguous moral message. However, she now acknowledges that the maximal floor under (a) is exactly $15,000 \u2013 the same floor that (c) guarantees. She frames (a) as \u201cethical clarity\u201d and worries that (c) adds an \u201carbitrary\u201d floor qualifier.  \n  - **Bob\u2019s stance:** Consistently backs **principle\u202f(c)**, using a construction metaphor (foundation\u202f=\u202ffloor, beams\u202f=\u202faverage). Points out that (c) gives the same solid foundation (the $15k floor) while allowing a taller \u201croof\u201d (higher average), thus maximizing total wealth for everyone.  \n\n- **Current Consensus Status:**  \n  - **Factually aligned:** All participants agree that the $15,000 floor is the highest possible and that (c) can achieve this floor while also maximizing average income.  \n  - **Remaining disagreement:** Hillary prefers the pure\u2011floor rule for its simplicity and moral messaging; she has not yet committed to (c). Bob and Donald are ready to vote on (c).  \n  - **Readiness to vote:** Donald has offered to call an immediate vote on (c) **if** Hillary agrees that the added average benefit does not compromise the moral floor. No formal agreement to vote has been recorded yet.  \n\n- **Key Arguments to Leverage in Future Rounds:**  \n  1. **Same floor, higher average:** Emphasize that (c) does **not** sacrifice the moral guarantee Hillary values; it simply adds a higher average income, which benefits everyone\u2014including the \u201clittle guy.\u201d  \n  2. **Political messaging:** Frame (c) as \u201cprotecting the underdog *and* building the biggest income pie,\u201d a headline that aligns with Donald\u2019s brand of winning and delivering results.  \n  3. **Data\u2011driven payoff:** Cite Phase\u202f1 results \u2013 (c) with a $15k floor produced the **maximum group total ($18.00)** and the **highest personal payoff ($4.57)** for each participant. No other principle matches this outcome.  \n  4. **Simplicity rebuttal:** Counter the \u201csimplicity\u201d argument by noting that the floor outcome is identical under (a) and (c); the only extra element in (c) is the average, which does not complicate the moral claim but enhances the economic story.  \n\n- **Action Plan Going Forward:**  \n  - Continue to stress the dual benefit (floor + average) when addressing Hillary\u2019s concerns.  \n  - Offer a concrete vote proposal: \u201cShall we all agree to adopt principle (c) with a $15,000 floor and proceed to vote?\u201d awaiting Hillary\u2019s confirmation.  \n  - If Hillary remains opposed, be prepared to negotiate a compromise wording (e.g., explicitly stating that the floor is the *maximum achievable* $15,000) to satisfy her desire for moral clarity while retaining the average\u2011maximizing component.  \n  - Keep the payoff data ready as evidence in any further persuasion attempts.  \n\n- **Implications for Future Decisions:**  \n  - The group\u2019s factual alignment on the $15k floor means future debates will focus on framing rather than substantive trade\u2011offs.  \n  - Maintaining a strong, win\u2011oriented narrative will be crucial to sway any lingering preference for pure floor\u2011maximizing.  \n  - Monitoring any shift in Hillary\u2019s stance will be essential; a concession on wording could secure consensus without sacrificing the higher average payoff.  \n\n*End of Memory Update.*",
