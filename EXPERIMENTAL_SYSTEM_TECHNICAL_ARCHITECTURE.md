The MAAI implementation employs a sophisticated multi-layered architecture designed to maintain experimental fidelity while accommodating the operational constraints of large language model-based agents. The system architecture addresses three critical requirements: (i) precise replication of the informational structure and incentive mechanisms from the original \citet{Frohlich_Oppenheimer_1992_Book} protocol, (ii) robust handling of the inherent stochasticity and potential failure modes of AI agent interactions, and (iii) comprehensive data collection that enables both quantitative analysis of choice patterns and qualitative examination of reasoning processes.

The system implements two distinct agent types, each serving specialized functions within the experimental framework. \textbf{Participant agents} represent the primary experimental subjects and are designed to simulate human decision-making processes around questions of distributive justice. Each participant agent is instantiated with configurable characteristics including personality profiles, reasoning capabilities, memory constraints, and model-specific parameters. The agents employ a sophisticated memory management system with configurable character limits (default 50,000 characters) that persists across both experimental phases, enabling agents to accumulate experience and strategic insights throughout the experiment. This continuous memory architecture ensures that Phase 2 group discussions are informed by Phase 1 individual learning experiences, replicating the informational structure of the original human experiment.

\textbf{Bank Account and Economic Incentive Systems.} Each participant agent maintains a persistent bank account that tracks accumulated earnings throughout the experimental sequence, directly replicating the economic incentive structure from the original \citet{Frohlich_Oppenheimer_1992_Book} protocol. The bank account system begins each agent with a zero balance and records all earnings from the four principle application rounds in Phase 1, maintaining running totals that inform subsequent decision-making. During each application round, when an agent is randomly assigned to an income class within their chosen distribution, their earnings are calculated using the same 1:\$10,000 conversion rate employed in the original experiment and immediately credited to their account. This approach ensures that agents experience the same economic consequences for their choices as human participants, with earnings accumulating across rounds to create meaningful financial stakes. The bank account balance is continuously accessible to agents through their memory system and is explicitly referenced in prompts, ensuring that accumulated wealth influences subsequent decision-making in ways that parallel human participant behavior. In Phase 2, the bank account serves as the baseline for additional earnings based on group consensus outcomes, with successful consensus generating additional payoffs according to the group-selected principle, while consensus failure results in random payoff assignment. The economic tracking system maintains detailed records of all earnings sources, enabling researchers to analyze how accumulated wealth influences both individual preference evolution and group decision-making processes.

\textbf{Utility agents} serve specialized parsing and validation functions, addressing the challenge of extracting structured information from free-text agent responses. These agents employ multiple parsing strategies including regular expression patterns, semantic analysis, and large language model-based interpretation to extract principle choices, constraint specifications, certainty levels, and reasoning explanations. The utility agents implement sophisticated validation mechanisms that ensure participants who select constraint-based principles (maximizing average with floor constraint or range constraint) provide valid constraint amounts in dollar terms, replicating the validation requirements from the original protocol.

The agent architecture supports heterogeneous configurations within single experiments, enabling researchers to vary model providers (OpenAI GPT models, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, or other providers via OpenRouter), temperature settings, personality characteristics, and reasoning capabilities across participants. This flexibility enables examination of how different AI architectures and configurations approach questions of distributive justice while maintaining experimental comparability.

\subsubsection{Experimental Orchestration and Phase Management}

The experimental flow is orchestrated by specialized phase managers that coordinate the complex sequence of individual and group interactions while maintaining strict adherence to the original \citet{Frohlich_Oppenheimer_1992_Book} protocol. The \textbf{Phase 1 Manager} handles individual familiarization processes, implementing parallel execution to minimize runtime while ensuring complete isolation between agents. Each agent progresses through the identical sequence: initial principle ranking, detailed explanation with reference distributions, four iterative principle application rounds, and final ranking assessment.

During principle application rounds, the system replicates the exact distributional scenarios from the original experiment. The \textbf{Original Values Mode} uses predefined distribution sets that correspond precisely to those employed by \citet{Frohlich_Oppenheimer_1992_Book}, including the income values presented in Table~\ref{Tab:Distribution_Table} and subsequent variations. The system implements the same probability structures for income class assignments, with careful attention to the probability derivation challenges noted in the original study. For distribution sets where multiple feasible probability vectors existed, the system employs the same selection approach as the original experiment. For cases where no non-negative solution satisfied all constraints, the system implements the adjusted probability vectors while maintaining the displayed averages, preserving the informational structure presented to participants.

The \textbf{Phase 2 Manager} orchestrates group discussions using a structured approach that balances experimental control with natural conversation flow. Unlike the unlimited discussion time in the human experiment, the MAAI implementation employs fixed-duration rounds with randomized speaking orders to prevent indefinite exchanges while ensuring balanced participation. The system implements sophisticated consensus detection mechanisms that examine both exact agreement (identical principle choices with identical constraint amounts) and semantic consensus (same principle with similar constraint specifications within configurable tolerance levels).

\subsubsection{Multi-Language and Cultural Adaptation Framework}

The system provides comprehensive multi-language support for English, Spanish, and Mandarin Chinese, enabling cross-cultural replication of the \citet{Frohlich_Oppenheimer_1992_Book} experiment. The localization framework goes beyond literal translation to incorporate culturally appropriate concepts, numerical representations, and communication styles while preserving the essential experimental structure. All experimental prompts, principle descriptions, and feedback mechanisms are available in culturally adapted versions that maintain semantic equivalence across languages.

The cultural adaptation framework addresses several technical challenges specific to multi-agent AI systems. Agent personality profiles are adapted to reflect cultural norms and expectations while maintaining experimental comparability. Response parsing and validation systems accommodate linguistic variations in expression of justice preferences and constraint specifications. The consensus detection mechanisms account for cultural differences in communication styles and agreement expressions while maintaining consistent experimental standards.

\subsubsection{Distribution Generation and Principle Application Systems}

The system implements two distinct modes for income distribution generation, addressing different research objectives and experimental requirements. \textbf{Dynamic Generation Mode} produces novel distribution sets for each experimental session using configurable multiplier ranges applied to base distributions. This approach ensures experimental uniqueness and prevents strategic gaming based on memorized distribution patterns, while maintaining the same structural relationships between income classes and principle applications as the original study.

\textbf{Original Values Mode} provides exact replication capabilities using the predefined distribution sets from \citet{Frohlich_Oppenheimer_1992_Book}. This mode incorporates the complete series of distribution scenarios used in the original study, including the base distributions shown in Table~\ref{Tab:Distribution_Table} and the systematically varied scenarios employed in the four practice rounds. The mode preserves the exact probability weightings for income class assignments, including the situation-specific variations implemented across different experimental conditions.

The principle application system implements precise algorithms for determining which distribution corresponds to each justice principle given the participant's constraint specifications. For maximizing floor income, the system identifies the distribution with the highest minimum value. For maximizing average income, the system calculates weighted averages using the appropriate probability distributions and selects the distribution with the highest expected value. For constraint-based principles, the system implements the conditional logic described in the original protocol, first filtering distributions that satisfy the constraint and then applying the maximization criterion among feasible options.

\subsubsection{Memory Management and Learning Architecture}

A critical innovation of the MAAI implementation is the sophisticated memory management system that enables agents to accumulate and integrate experience across experimental phases. Unlike human participants who rely on natural cognitive processes for information retention and integration, AI agents require explicit memory structures and update mechanisms to achieve comparable learning effects.

The system implements \textbf{agent-managed memory} where participants maintain and update their own memory stores throughout the experiment. After each significant experimental interaction (principle applications, discussion contributions, vote outcomes), agents are prompted to update their memory with relevant information, lessons learned, and strategic insights. This approach preserves agent autonomy in determining what information to retain and how to structure their accumulated knowledge, while ensuring that Phase 2 discussions are informed by Phase 1 experiences.

The memory system implements sophisticated error handling for situations where agent memory exceeds character limits, providing multiple retry opportunities for memory consolidation while preserving experimental continuity. The system tracks memory state evolution throughout the experiment, enabling researchers to examine how agent understanding and preferences develop through direct experience with principle applications and their consequences.

\subsubsection{Validation and Quality Assurance Systems}

The MAAI implementation addresses several unique validation challenges that arise when using large language model-based agents as experimental participants. The system implements comprehensive response validation mechanisms that ensure agent responses meet experimental requirements while accommodating the natural language variability inherent in AI agent outputs.

\textbf{Constraint Specification Validation} addresses a critical requirement from the original protocol: participants who select constraint-based principles must provide valid constraint amounts. The system implements multi-stage validation that first attempts to extract constraint amounts using pattern matching and semantic analysis, then validates that extracted amounts represent reasonable economic values, and finally re-prompts agents for clarification when specifications are incomplete or invalid.

\textbf{Ranking Consistency Validation} ensures that agent principle rankings are complete and internally consistent, preventing ties, omissions, or other violations of the experimental requirements. The system validates that each ranking includes all four principles in distinct positions and that certainty levels are provided on the specified discrete scale.

\textbf{Discussion Quality Assurance} addresses the challenge of ensuring that group discussion contributions are substantive and meaningful. The system implements content validation that identifies empty, repetitive, or nonsensical responses and provides retry opportunities with modified prompts that encourage more substantive engagement. For cases where agents fail to provide adequate responses after multiple attempts, the system implements fallback mechanisms that maintain experimental flow while documenting communication failures.

\subsubsection{Consensus Detection and Group Decision Mechanisms}

The group phase implementation employs sophisticated consensus detection algorithms that accommodate the linguistic complexity of natural language agent responses while maintaining the strict unanimity requirement from the original \citet{Frohlich_Oppenheimer_1992_Book} protocol. The system implements a multi-tiered approach to consensus determination that balances precision with practical feasibility.

\textbf{Exact Consensus Detection} represents the primary mechanism, identifying cases where all agents provide identical principle choices with identical constraint specifications. This approach ensures that consensus reflects genuine agreement rather than approximate alignment, maintaining the strict unanimity standard from the original experiment.

\textbf{Semantic Consensus Analysis} provides a secondary mechanism for cases where agents choose identical principles with similar but not exactly identical constraint amounts. The system employs configurable tolerance levels (default: 10\% of average constraint amount or minimum \$1,000) to determine whether constraint variations represent meaningful disagreement or natural language imprecision. This mechanism prevents artificial consensus failures due to minor linguistic variations while preserving the substantive agreement requirement.

\textbf{Vote Proposal and Agreement Systems} replicate the original protocol's requirement that voting occur only when all participants agree to conduct a vote. The system implements sophisticated natural language analysis to detect vote proposals in discussion contributions and coordinates unanimous agreement assessment before proceeding to secret ballot voting.

\subsubsection{Data Collection and Experimental Measurement Architecture}

The MAAI implementation incorporates comprehensive data collection mechanisms designed to capture both quantitative choice patterns and qualitative reasoning processes throughout the experimental sequence. The data architecture addresses the unique opportunities and challenges presented by AI agent-based experimentation, providing unprecedented visibility into agent decision-making processes while maintaining experimental validity.

\textbf{Agent-Centric Logging} captures complete experimental traces for each participant agent, including all prompts presented, responses generated, parsing results, validation attempts, and error conditions. The system maintains detailed memory state records that document how agent understanding and preferences evolve throughout the experiment, enabling analysis of learning processes and preference formation mechanisms.

\textbf{Economic Outcome Tracking} replicates the payoff measurement systems from the original experiment while extending data collection to include counterfactual analysis. The system records actual earnings received under chosen principles and calculates earnings that would have been received under alternative principles, both for the specific distribution selected and for the agent's assigned income class across all available distributions.

\textbf{Group Interaction Documentation} provides comprehensive records of discussion contributions, speaking order patterns, vote proposals, consensus assessment processes, and final agreement outcomes. The system captures both the public discussion content available to all agents and private reasoning processes (when reasoning modes are enabled), enabling analysis of the relationship between internal deliberation and public expression.

\textbf{Temporal and Sequential Analysis} capabilities enable researchers to examine how preferences and reasoning evolve over time, both within individual agents across experimental phases and across agents during group discussions. The system provides detailed timestamps and sequence markers that facilitate analysis of temporal patterns in preference formation and group convergence processes.

\subsubsection{Error Handling and Experimental Robustness}

Large language model-based experimental systems face unique challenges related to model availability, response variability, and potential failure modes that require sophisticated error handling and recovery mechanisms. The MAAI implementation addresses these challenges through a comprehensive error management architecture that ensures experimental robustness while maintaining data integrity.

\textbf{Communication Error Recovery} addresses failures in agent-model communication including timeout conditions, API availability issues, and malformed responses. The system implements exponential backoff retry mechanisms with configurable maximum attempts and provides fallback procedures that maintain experimental flow when communication failures cannot be resolved.

\textbf{Validation Failure Handling} addresses cases where agent responses fail to meet experimental requirements despite multiple retry attempts. The system implements graceful degradation procedures that document validation failures while providing reasonable fallback behaviors that enable experimental completion.

\textbf{Memory Management Error Resolution} handles situations where agent memory updates exceed character limits or encounter processing errors. The system provides multiple retry opportunities with abbreviated memory consolidation prompts and implements emergency memory truncation procedures when necessary to maintain experimental continuity.

\textbf{Consensus Detection Error Handling} addresses the complex challenge of group consensus determination when agent responses are ambiguous, contradictory, or incomplete. The system implements multiple consensus detection strategies and provides clear documentation of consensus determination rationale for subsequent analysis and validation.

\subsubsection{Reproducibility and Experimental Control Architecture}

The MAAI implementation incorporates comprehensive reproducibility mechanisms that enable precise experimental replication while accommodating the inherent stochasticity of large language model-based agents. These mechanisms address the unique challenges of maintaining experimental control in AI agent-based research while preserving the essential unpredictability that enables realistic simulation of human decision-making processes.

\textbf{Configuration Management} employs YAML-based experimental specifications that capture all relevant experimental parameters including agent configurations, distribution generation parameters, discussion round limits, consensus requirements, and error handling thresholds. Complete configuration files are embedded in experimental results to ensure that experimental conditions can be precisely reconstructed.

\textbf{Randomization Control} provides options for controlling randomization seeds in distribution generation, income class assignments, and speaking order determination. Researchers can specify fixed seeds for exact replication studies or employ system-generated seeds for independent replications with documented randomization sources.

\textbf{Model Version Documentation} addresses the challenge that language model capabilities and behaviors may evolve over time, potentially affecting experimental outcomes. The system documents model versions, provider specifications, and configuration parameters for all agents, enabling researchers to account for model-related variations in experimental outcomes.

\textbf{Cross-Platform Compatibility} ensures consistent results across different computing environments and infrastructure configurations, supporting collaborative research and result verification across different research institutions and computing platforms.

\subsubsection{Scalability and Performance Architecture}

The MAAI implementation is designed to support large-scale experimental programs including systematic parameter variations, cross-cultural studies, and longitudinal research programs. The architecture addresses computational efficiency concerns while maintaining experimental fidelity and data quality.

\textbf{Parallel Processing Optimization} leverages the independent nature of Phase 1 individual learning processes to execute multiple agent interactions simultaneously, significantly reducing experimental runtime. The system implements intelligent task scheduling that maximizes parallel execution opportunities while respecting API rate limits and resource constraints.

\textbf{Batch Experimental Execution} supports systematic execution of multiple experimental configurations with minimal manual intervention. Researchers can specify parameter grids for agent characteristics, experimental conditions, or distribution scenarios and execute comprehensive experimental programs automatically.

\textbf{Resource Management and API Optimization} implements intelligent request scheduling and caching mechanisms that minimize API usage costs while maintaining experimental integrity. The system provides detailed resource utilization reporting that enables cost estimation and optimization for large-scale experimental programs.

\textbf{Data Storage and Analysis Integration} provides efficient data storage mechanisms and analysis-ready output formats that facilitate downstream statistical analysis and visualization. The system generates structured data files that integrate seamlessly with standard econometric and statistical software packages.

\subsubsection{Limitations and Future Extensions}

While the MAAI implementation provides a sophisticated platform for studying distributive justice preferences and group decision-making processes, several limitations and opportunities for future development merit consideration.

\textbf{Agent Validity and Anthropomorphism Concerns} represent fundamental questions about the extent to which AI agent preferences and reasoning processes provide valid models for human cognition and decision-making. The current implementation enables systematic comparison with human experimental data from \citet{Frohlich_Oppenheimer_1992_Book}, but questions remain about the generalizability of AI agent behaviors to human populations and the potential influence of training data biases on observed preference patterns.

\textbf{Strategic Behavior and Game-Theoretic Considerations} are not explicitly incorporated in the current implementation, which focuses on replicating the original experimental protocol rather than extending it to incorporate strategic interaction effects. Future extensions could incorporate game-theoretic analysis capabilities to examine strategic behavior in distributive justice contexts and the relationship between individual preferences and strategic group interaction.

\textbf{Dynamic and Longitudinal Extensions} could examine how distributive justice preferences evolve over extended time periods or through repeated experimental interactions. The current architecture provides the foundation for such extensions through its sophisticated memory management and data tracking capabilities.

\textbf{Cultural and Cross-National Extensions} represent significant opportunities for extending the \citet{Frohlich_Oppenheimer_1992_Book} experimental program to examine cultural variations in distributive justice preferences. The existing multi-language architecture provides the technical foundation for systematic cross-cultural research programs that could yield important insights into universal versus culture-specific patterns in justice reasoning.

This comprehensive technical architecture enables the MAAI implementation to serve as both a precise replication platform for the seminal \citet{Frohlich_Oppenheimer_1992_Book} experiment and a flexible foundation for extending distributive justice research into new domains and research questions. The system's sophisticated error handling, comprehensive data collection, and rigorous experimental controls ensure that AI agent-based experiments can achieve the same standards of rigor and validity that characterize high-quality human subject research while offering unique advantages in terms of scalability, reproducibility, and detailed process observation.
