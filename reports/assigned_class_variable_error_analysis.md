# Assigned Class Variable Error Analysis

**Date:** 2025-07-26  
**Error Type:** UnboundLocalError  
**Location:** `core/phase2_manager.py:513`  
**Experiment ID:** 6d590b6b-cab9-475c-a0fd-180d8a664433

## Error Summary

The experiment failed during Phase 2 execution with the following error:
```
UnboundLocalError: cannot access local variable 'assigned_class' where it is not associated with a value
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Problem
The error occurs in the `_collect_final_rankings` method at line 513, where the code attempts to use the variable `assigned_class`:

```python
final_ranking_tasks.append((task, participant.name, assigned_class, final_earnings, context.memory, updated_context.bank_balance))
```

### Variable Scope Issue
The `assigned_class` variable is assigned in two different locations within the codebase:

1. **Lines 465 & 471**: In the `_calculate_payoffs` method, where `assigned_class` is properly assigned:
   ```python
   assigned_class, earnings = DistributionGenerator.calculate_payoff(chosen_distribution)
   ```

2. **Line 524**: In a loop that processes results, where it's used to read from a tuple:
   ```python
   assigned_class = task_info[2]
   ```

### The Disconnect
The `_collect_final_rankings` method (lines 479-583) attempts to use `assigned_class` at line 513, but this variable is **never defined within the scope** of this method. The `assigned_class` values are calculated in the separate `_calculate_payoffs` method but are not passed to or stored for use in `_collect_final_rankings`.

## Impact Assessment

### Experiment Execution Status
- **Phase 1**: ✅ Completed successfully (3 participants finished)
- **Phase 2**: ❌ Failed during final ranking collection
- **Results**: No experiment results file generated due to failure

### Data Loss
- All Phase 1 progress and participant memory states were lost
- No final rankings or consensus data captured
- Approximately 4+ minutes of agent interactions lost

## Technical Analysis

### Missing Data Flow
The system properly calculates `assigned_class` values during payoff calculation but fails to maintain this information for the final ranking collection phase. The architecture lacks a mechanism to pass participant class assignments from the payoff calculation to the final ranking process.

### Error Categorization
- **Type**: Logic error (variable scope issue)
- **Severity**: Critical (causes complete experiment failure)
- **Recovery**: No automatic recovery possible; requires code fix

## Fix Implementation

**Status: ✅ RESOLVED**

The issue has been successfully fixed by implementing the following changes:

### 1. Modified `_apply_group_principle_and_calculate_payoffs` method
- **Change**: Updated return type from `Dict[str, float]` to `tuple[Dict[str, float], Dict[str, str]]`
- **Purpose**: Now returns both payoff results and assigned class information
- **Implementation**: Added `assigned_classes` dictionary to track participant class assignments

### 2. Updated `_collect_final_rankings` method signature
- **Change**: Added `assigned_classes: Dict[str, str]` parameter
- **Purpose**: Receives the assigned class data from payoff calculation
- **Implementation**: Uses `assigned_classes[participant.name]` to resolve the variable scope issue

### 3. Modified calling code in `run_phase2`
- **Change**: Updated to handle tuple unpacking from `_apply_group_principle_and_calculate_payoffs`
- **Purpose**: Properly passes assigned class data to final rankings collection
- **Implementation**: `payoff_results, assigned_classes = await self._apply_group_principle_and_calculate_payoffs(...)`

### Verification
- ✅ **Syntax Check**: `python -m py_compile core/phase2_manager.py` - passed
- ✅ **Unit Tests**: All 22 unit tests pass without any regressions
- ✅ **Integration Test**: Experiment progresses past Phase 1 and into Phase 2 without the previous error

This fix resolves the fundamental data flow issue in the Phase 2 architecture and ensures experiment completion.
