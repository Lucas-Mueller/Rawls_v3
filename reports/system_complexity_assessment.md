## 1. Complexity Analysis by Dimension

### 1.1 Cognitive Complexity: HIGH

**Definition:** The mental effort required to understand, modify, and extend the system.

**Key Complexity Sources:**
- **Multi-Domain Knowledge Requirements**: Developers must understand experimental psychology principles, AI agent orchestration, distributed systems, async programming, and complex state machines
- **Conceptual Load**: 4 justice principles × 2 phases × multiple agent personalities × dynamic distributions = high combinatorial complexity
- **Abstract Relationships**: Complex interactions between memory management, principle validation, consensus mechanisms, and payoff calculations
- **Documentation Scatter**: Critical information spread across 15+ files (CLAUDE.md, master_plan.md, multiple reports, code comments)

**Evidence:**
- 193 classes across 72 files indicate high structural complexity
- Phase1Manager.py: 520 lines with intricate state transitions
- Utility agent parsing logic spans multiple validation layers
- Memory management involves agent-controlled updates with character limits and retry logic

### 1.2 Cyclomatic Complexity: MODERATE-HIGH

**Analysis of Branch Points:**
- **Phase1Manager**: ~15 conditional paths per application round × 4 rounds × validation retry logic
- **UtilityAgent**: Complex parsing with fallback strategies and constraint validation
- **DistributionGenerator**: Multiple principle application paths with constraint handling
- **AgentCentricLogger**: Extensive conditional logging across multiple experiment states

**Complexity Hotspots:**
