## Phase 2: Group Phase Comparison

### Discussion Structure

#### Basic Framework
**Original Procedure:**
> "The five participants deliberate to reach unanimous agreement on one principle."

**Current Implementation:**
- ✅ **Group Size**: 5 participants (`len(self.participants)`)
- ✅ **Unanimous Consensus**: Exact matching required for consensus
- ✅ **Sequential Rounds**: Up to `config.phase2_rounds` (default 4)
- **Enhancement**: Randomized speaking order to prevent bias

#### Discussion Rules
**Original Procedure:**
> "Discussion must last at least five minutes and culminate in a verbal consensus and a confirming secret-ballot vote."

**Current Implementation:**
**Adaptations for AI:**
- **Time Requirement**: Replaced with round-based structure (4 rounds max)
- **Secret Ballot**: `_conduct_group_vote()` with anonymous voting
- **Consensus Check**: Both exact and semantic matching algorithms
- **Vote Agreement**: All participants must agree to vote before proceeding

**Rationale**: Time-based requirements don't apply to AI agents; round-based structure ensures adequate discussion.

#### Consensus Mechanism
**Original Procedure:**
> "Unanimous agreement required"

**Current Implementation:**
- ✅ **Exact Consensus**: `_check_exact_consensus()` - identical principle + constraint
- **Enhancement**: `_check_semantic_consensus()` - fuzzy matching for constraints (±10% tolerance)
- **Fallback**: Random assignment if no consensus reached

**Example Consensus Logic:**
```python
# Exact matching (original standard)
all_votes_identical = all(vote.principle == first_vote.principle and 
                         vote.constraint_amount == first_vote.constraint_amount 
                         for vote in votes)

# Semantic matching (enhancement)
if constraint_range <= tolerance:  # 10% of average or min $1000
    semantic_consensus = True
```

**Fidelity Assessment**: **HIGH** - Core requirement maintained with practical enhancements.

#### Vote Proposal Detection
**Current Enhancement:**
- **Added**: Automated vote proposal detection in statements
- **Trigger Phrases**: "I propose we vote", "ready to vote", "time to vote", etc.
- **Unanimous Agreement**: All participants must agree before voting proceeds
- **Impact**: **Positive Enhancement** - Streamlines transition to voting phase

## Justice Principles Implementation

### Principle Definitions
**Original Procedure Principles:**
1. "Maximizing the floor income": Highest floor income
2. "Maximizing the average income": Highest total/average income  
3. "Maximizing the average with a floor constraint of X$": Average maximization with minimum guarantee
4. "Maximizing the average with a range constraint of X$": Average maximization with inequality limit

**Current Implementation:**
```python
class JusticePrinciple(str, Enum):
    MAXIMIZING_FLOOR = "maximizing_floor"
    MAXIMIZING_AVERAGE = "maximizing_average" 
    MAXIMIZING_AVERAGE_FLOOR_CONSTRAINT = "maximizing_average_floor_constraint"
    MAXIMIZING_AVERAGE_RANGE_CONSTRAINT = "maximizing_average_range_constraint"
```

**Application Logic Verification:**

#### Maximizing Floor
**Original**: "Distribution D" (highest low income: $15,000)
**Current**: `max(distributions, key=lambda d: d.low)` ✅

#### Maximizing Average  
**Original**: "Distribution A" (highest average)
**Current**: `max(distributions, key=lambda d: d.get_average_income(probabilities))` ✅
**Enhancement**: Supports weighted averages using probability distribution

#### Floor Constraint Application
**Original Logic:**
- If X ≤ 12,000$: Distribution A
- If X ≤ 13,000$: Distribution B
- If X ≤ 14,000$: Distribution B
- If X ≤ 15,000$: Distribution D

**Current Implementation:**
```python
valid_distributions = [d for d in distributions if d.low >= floor_constraint]
if valid_distributions:
    best_dist = max(valid_distributions, key=lambda d: d.get_average_income(probabilities))
```

**Fidelity Assessment**: **PERFECT** - Logic exactly matches original decision tree.

#### Range Constraint Application
**Original Logic:**
- If X ≥ 20,000$: Distribution A
- If X ≥ 17,000$: Distribution C  
- If X ≥ 15,000$: Distribution B

**Current Implementation:**
```python
valid_distributions = [d for d in distributions if d.get_range() <= range_constraint]
if valid_distributions:
    best_dist = max(valid_distributions, key=lambda d: d.get_average_income(probabilities))
```

**Fidelity Assessment**: **PERFECT** - Maintains original constraint-filtering logic.

## Potential Areas for Alignment Improvement

### Minor Considerations

#### 1. Time Element in Phase 2
**Current Gap**: No minimum discussion time equivalent
**Suggestion**: Could implement minimum statements per participant before voting allowed

#### 2. Physical Chit Experience
**Current**: Digital table format
**Original**: Physical chit with tangible counterfactuals
**Impact**: Low - information content preserved

#### 3. Vote Timing Precision
**Current**: Vote can occur mid-round after proposal
**Original**: Vote occurs after full discussion period
**Impact**: Minimal - maintains consensus requirement

### Configuration Recommendations

For maximum fidelity to original procedure, consider:
```yaml
# Stricter alignment settings
phase2_minimum_statements_per_participant: 2
vote_proposal_cooldown_rounds: 1  # Prevent immediate voting
require_all_participants_speak_before_vote: true
```
